This is the live session work space for the course. Our goal with this repository, is that we're able to communicate \emph{ahead of time} our aims for each week, and that you can prepare accordingly.

\hypertarget{blooms-taxonomy}{%
\section*{Bloom's Taxonomy}\label{blooms-taxonomy}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Bloom's Taxonomy}

An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as \emph{Bloom's Taxonomy}, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one \emph{level} of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning.

In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept \emph{is}, or why the concept works in the way that it does.
\item
  \textbf{Apply} A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem.
\item
  \textbf{Analyze} A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be.
\item
  \textbf{Evaluate} A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals.
\item
  \textbf{Create} A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.
\end{enumerate}

Identity shapes how people approach and understand their world. We would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course.

However, every one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  It doesn't matter if you've never taken a stats class before, or if you're reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome.
\item
  It doesn't matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless.
\item
  The color of your skin doesn't matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University's \href{https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community}{Principles of Community}.

\hypertarget{probability-theory}{%
\section{Probability Theory}\label{probability-theory}}

\textbf{Probability}

Probability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually \emph{every} other model you'll ever use as a data scientist.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/picard.jpg}
\caption{picard}
\end{figure}

In this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it.

In introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes' Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you'll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform -- squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull -- variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful \emph{information} from your data.

As you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely \emph{next} word or words that someone might type?

Beyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner.

First, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a \emph{much} fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e.~compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn't clearly fit into a box, there's no way to move forward.

\begin{quote}
Statistics like this is not fun.
\end{quote}

In the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you're able to learn \emph{why} certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven't seen before.

The second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements \emph{nearly always} developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language.

  \item

\end{enumerate}

To represent 10 waves, you should use \(\mathbb{R}^{10}\). It is curious mathematical fact that \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^{10}\) actually have the same cardinality -- there are the same number of elements in each of these sets and there exists a function -- i.e.~a one-to-one mapping -- between these sets.

\hypertarget{proofs-style-counts}{%
\section{Proofs: Style Counts}\label{proofs-style-counts}}

In each week of a class, you are either caught up or behind.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability that you are caught up in Week 1 is 0.7.
\item
  If you are caught up in a given week, the probability that you will be caught up in the next week is 0.7.
\item
  If you are behind in a given week, the probability that you will be caught up in the next week is 0.4.
\item
  \textbf{What is the probability that you are caught up in week 3?}
\end{itemize}

Identify as many ways to improve this proof as you can:

If you are caught up in a week, there are two possibilities for the previous week: caught up and behind. Let \(P(C)\) be the probability of being caught up. In week 1, \(P(C) = .7\). The probability of being behind is \(P(B) = 1 - .7 = .3\). We first break down the probability for week 2:

\[P(C) = .7 \cdot .7 + .3 \cdot .4 = .65\]

Now we can repeat the process for week 3:

\[P(C) = .65 * .7 + .35 * .4 = .595\]

\hypertarget{learning-objectives-1}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}}

At the end of this week's course of study (which includes the async, sync, and homework) students should be able to

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} that random variable are neither random, or variables, but instead that they are a foundational object that we can use to reason about a world.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} that the intuition developed by the use of set-theory probability maps into the more expressive space of random variables
\item
  \textbf{Apply} the appropriate mathematical transformations to move between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.
\end{enumerate}

From the axioms of probability, it is possible to build a whole, expressive modeling system (that need not be grounded \textbf{at all} in the minutia of the world). With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are \emph{closer to the truth} than predictions made without this information.

There is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function.

The beauty is that by reasoning with such general objects we can produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function.

The tragedy is that in the ``real world'', the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. In examples that we compute, to provide a chance to reason about these objects, we will typically write down a \emph{specific} function that a random variable represents, despite the limitation that we cannot directly observe this function in the wild.

And, working together with a group will help you to find people who share data science interests with you.

What is a random variable? Does this definition help you?

\begin{definition}{}
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-1}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-1} \textbackslash iffalse (Random Variable) \fi{} }A random variable is a function \(X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) such that \(\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \{\omega \in \Omega\}: X(\omega) \leq r\} \in S\).
\end{definition}

Someone, please, read that without using a single ``omega'', \(\mathbb{R}\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean.

The goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be \emph{absolutely} clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student's home language.

Suppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you're hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearily with each block that you cross.

\hypertarget{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}{%
\section{Moving Between PDF and CDF}\label{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}}

The book defines \emph{pmf} and \emph{cmf} first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the \emph{cdf}, which is the cumulative density function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it.

More importantly for this course, in \textbf{Definition 1.2.15} the book defines the relationship between \emph{cdf} and \emph{pdf} in the following way:

\begin{definition}{}
\protect\hypertarget{def:unnamed-chunk-5}{}{\label{def:unnamed-chunk-5} \textbackslash iffalse (Probability Density Function (PDF)) \fi{} }For a continous random variable \(X\) with CDF \(F\), the \emph{probability density function} of \(X\) is

\]\\

Here is the true density function for a normal random variable.

\includegraphics{203-live-session_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}

\textbf{Simulate Draws}

There's another way to get an \textbf{approximate} idea of what the distribution looks like. Here's how we take a single draw from a normal distribution with a specific set of features:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{mean =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sd =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 2.217368
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Repeating the Experiment}

We want to rerun that experiment 10 times. We take a draw, then rewind time, clear our memory and start over with fresh randomness. To do this in R, an easy way is with the \texttt{replicate()} function. Change the code below so that it repeats the experiment above 10 times, then use \texttt{hist()} to display a plot of the result.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{simulation }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{replicate}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{n    =} \DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{,      }\CommentTok{\# should you change this line? }

\item
  The repetition we're using has no analogue in the real world -- we don't get to shake up the world like a snow globe a number of times in a row to see what it does.

\item
  Your instructor will assign you to Proof 1, Proof 2, OR Proof 3.
\item
  First, study your proof.
\item
  Second, in breakout rooms, teach your proof to your classmates.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proof 1}

We first compute the CDF of Y. For \(0 \leq y \leq 1\),

\[
F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(X^2 \leq y) = P(X \leq \sqrt{y}) = \sqrt{y}
\]
Next, we take the derivative to get Y's density for \(0 \leq y \leq 1\):

\[
f_Y(y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} F_Y(y) = \frac{1}{2} y^{-1/2}
\]

(On your assignments, make sure you write a complete expression) Finally,

\[ 
E[Y] = \int_0^1 y f_Y(y) dy = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{2} y^{1/2} dy = \frac{1}{3}y^{3/2} \Bigg|_{y=0}^1 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

\textbf{Proof 2}

Apply the bonus result from HW 2: Note that \(Y=h(x)\) where \(h(x)= x^2\). For \(0 \leq y \leq 1\),

\[
f_{Y}(y) =   f_X(h^{-1}(y)) \cdot \left| \frac{d}{dy} h^{-1}(y) \right| = f_X(\sqrt{y}) \left| \frac{d}{dy} \sqrt{y} \right| = 1\cdot  \frac{1}{2} y^{-1/2}
\]

(On your assignments, make sure you write a complete expression) Finally, we find the expectation:

\[
E[Y] = \int_0^1 y f_Y(y) dy = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{2} y^{1/2} dy = \frac{1}{3}y^{3/2} \Bigg|_{y=0}^1 = \frac{1}{3} - 0 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

\textbf{Proof 3}

Apply the Law of the Unthinking Statistician (LOTUS):

\[
E[Y] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 f_X(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^0 x^2 \cdot 0 + \int_0^1 x^2 \cdot 1 dx + \int_1^{\infty} x^2 \cdot 0
\]

\[
E[Y] = 0 + \frac{1}{3}x^3 \Bigg|_0^1 +  0 = \frac{1}{3}
\]

\item
  Linearity is a very powerful property. Using it can often make your solutions much cleaner.

  (Question 1) In both, we have a probability density function multiplied by the values that we realize; this is basically serving as a ``weighting'' function, we're merely changing what that weighting function is!
\item
  In both cases we're looking at a ``mean'' of a distribution -- in one it is just a ``conditional mean'' than a ``marginal mean''.
\item
  (Question 2) We integrate \(Y\) out completely by using its every value in the integral, so \(E\) will not have \(Y\) in the answer -- instead, it will remain a function of \(X\).
\item
  \(f_{Y|X=x}\) is a function of \(x\)! So, the conditional expectation is some function \(x\) as well.
\item
  (Optional to discuss; probably too minute) An observation that some parsing students will make:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Without fixing \(X\) to some realization (denoted as a ``little x'', \(x\), then \(E[Y|X]\) is a function of \(X\) and so the whole statement is a function of a random variable (i.e.~\(E[Y|X]\) is \emph{itself} a RV).
  \item
    Once we fix \(X=x\), then \(E[Y|X=x]\) is fixed to some constant -- there is one value that \(E[Y|X=x]\) maps to.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  (Question 3) That isn't a function of anything! Once you've computed \(E[E[Y|X]]\), you've integrated out all variables!

  Theorem 2.2.20 states:
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
The CEF \(E[Y|X]\) is the ``best'' predictor of \(Y\) given \(X\), where ``best'' means it has the smallest mean squared error (MSE).
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Task:} Justify every transition (``='' sign) of the proof below using earlier FOAS concepts, definitions, theorems, calculus, and algebraic operations.
\item
  \textbf{Proof:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We need to find such function \(g: R \to R\) that gives the smallest \(E[(Y-g(X))^2]\).
  \item
    It should turn out that \(g(X)\) is actually \(E[Y|X]\).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Deriving a Function to Minimize MSE
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
  E[(Y - g(X))^2|X]
      &= E[Y^2 - 2Yg(X) + g^2(X)|X]                   \\
      &= E[Y^2|X] + E[-2Yg(X)|X] + E[g^2(X)|X]      \\
      &= E[Y^2|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)E[1|X]      \\
      &= (E[Y^2|X] - E^2[Y|X]) + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)) \\
      &= V[Y|X] + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)) \\
      &= V[Y|X] + (E[Y|X] - g(X))^2                  \\
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Then we have:
  \begin{align*}
  E[(Y-g(X))^2] &= E\big[E[(Y-g(X))^2|X]\big] \\ 
    &=E\big[V[Y|X]+(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2\big]\\
    &=E\big[V[Y|X]\big]+E\big[(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2\big]\\
  \end{align*}
\item
  \(E[V[Y|X]]\) doesn't depend on \(g\); and,
\item
  \(E[(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2]\ge 0\).
\end{itemize}

\(\therefore g(X) = E[Y|X]\) gives the smallest \(E[(Y-g(X))^2]\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Implication:} If you are choosing some \(g\), you can't do better than \(g(x) = E[Y|X=x]\).

Why Linear?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In some cases, we might try to estimate the CEF. More commonly, however, we work with linear predictors. Why?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We don't know joint density function of \(Y\). So, it is ``difficult'' to derive a suitable CEF.
\item
  To estimate \emph{flexible} functions requires considerably more data. Assumptions about distribution (e.g.~a linear form) allow you to leverage those assumptions to learn `more' from the same amount of data.
\item
  Other times, the CEF, even if we \emph{could} produce an estimate, might be so complex that it isn't useful or would be difficult to work with.
\item
  And, many times, linear predictors (which might seem trivially simple) actually do a very good job of producing predictions that are `close' or useful.

\item
  The sample mean is a random variable. To understand it, use the visualization trick from a few weeks ago. Use the \texttt{replicate} function to run the above experiment 1000 times, and plot a histogram of the results.
\item
  If you replicate the experiment enough times, will the distribution ever look normal? Why or why not?
\item
  Use \texttt{sd()} to check the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean for \texttt{number\_of\_coins\ =\ 3}. What sample size is needed to decrease the standard deviation by a factor of 10? Check that your answer is correct.
\end{enumerate}

For this part, we'll continue to study a fair coin.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}

\item
  Try different values for the sample size n, and examine the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean. At what point does it look normal to you?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 3}

For this part, we'll study a very unfair coin. \texttt{p\ =\ 0.01}.

This is an example of a highly skewed random variable. That roughly means that one tail is a lot longer than the other.

For this activity, you can simply use your eyes to gauge how skewed a distribution is. If you prefer, you can also use the skewness command in the univar package to measure skewness. You may hear a rule of thumb that a skewness above 1 or below -1 is a highly skewed distribution.

\begin{enumerate}

  Start with n=3 as before. What do you notice about the shape of the sampling distribution?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  Sometimes, the model includes an ``outcome'' random variable \(Y\) and ``input'' random variables \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\).
\item
  The joint distribution of \(Y\) and \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\) is complicated.
\item
  The best linear predictor (BLP) is the canonical way to summarize the relationship.

\textbf{Today}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  OLS regression is an estimator for the BLP
\item

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}

  Population :: Sample
\item
  Error \(\epsilon\) :: residuals :: \(e_{i}\)

\item
  Assess the assumptions of the Large-Sample Linear Model.
\item
  Create a scatterplot of \texttt{price} and \texttt{sqrft}. Like every plot you make, ensure that the plot \emph{minimally} has a title and meaningful axes.

\item
  Regress \texttt{price} on \texttt{sqrft} using the \texttt{lm} function. This will produce an estimate for the following model:

  The joint distribution of \(Y\) and \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\) is complicated.

\subsection{Understanding Uncertainty}\label{understanding-uncertainty}}

Under the relatively stricter assumptions of constant error variance, the variance of a slope coefficient is given by

\[
  V(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_j (1-R_j^2)}
\]

A similar formulation is given in \emph{FOAS} as definition 4.2.3,

\[
  \hat{V}_{C}[\hat{\beta}] = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left( X^{T} X \right)^{-1} \rightsquigarrow \frac{\hat{\sigma}^{2}}{\left( X^{T}X\right)}
\]

Explain why each term makes the variance higher or lower:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of the error \(\epsilon\)
\item
  \(SST_j\) is (unscaled) variance of \(X_j\)
\item
  \(R_j^2\) is \(R^2\) for a regression of \(X_j\) on the other \(X\)'s

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate a new model (and save it into another object) that includes the size of the lot and whether the house is a colonial. This will estimate the model:
\end{enumerate}

\[ 
  price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial? + e
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{BUT BEFORE YOU DO}, make a prediction: What do you think is going to happen to the coefficient that relates square footage and price?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Will the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Will the \emph{uncertainty} about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Conduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model \emph{as a whole} does better when the coefficients on \texttt{colonial} and \texttt{lotsize} are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e.~\(\beta_{2} = \beta_{3} = 0\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Use the function \texttt{vcovHC} from the \texttt{sandwich} package to estimate (a) the the heteroskedastic consistent (i.e.~``robust'') variance covariance matrix; and (b) the robust standard errors for the intercept and slope of this regression. Recall, what is the relationship between the VCOV and SE in a regression?
\item
  Perform a hypothesis test to check whether the population relationship between \texttt{sqrft} and \texttt{price} is zero. Use \texttt{coeftest()} with the robust standard errors computed above.
\item
  Use the robust standard error and \texttt{qt} to compute a 95\% confidence interval for the coefficient \texttt{sqrft} in the second model that you estimated. \(price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial\).
\item
  \textbf{Bootstrap.} The book \emph{very} quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling \emph{with replacement} and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have.
\end{enumerate}

Below is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the \texttt{sqrft} variable when \texttt{lotsize} and \texttt{colonial} are included in the model.

\textbf{Team Work Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Most data science work happens on teams.
\item
  Our educational goals include helping you improve in your role as a teammate.
\item
  We'll ask you to fill out a confidential evaluation regarding your team dynamics.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Presentation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Team will present their work in live session 14.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Teams have between 10-15 min dedicated to discussing their work (depending on section size)
  \item
    Two-thirds of the time can be the team presenting
  \item
    \textbf{BUT} at least one-third should be asking and answering questions with your peers
  \item
    For example, if teams have 15 minutes total, then plan to present for no more than 10 minutes and structure 5 minutes of questions.

  The BLP is a useful way to summarize relationships in a model, and OLS regression is a way to estimate the BLP.
\item

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Today}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Questions of explanation require a substantially different modeling process.
\item
  To answer causal questions, we must work within a causal theory
\item
  OLS regression is sometimes appropriate for measuring a causal effect,
\item
  But, only when the model estimated matches the causal theory.
\item
  So, we must watch out for omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and outcome variables on the right hand side.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The famous Classical Linear Model (CLM) allows us to apply regression to smaller samples.
\item
  We will address the pervasive issue of false discovery, and ways to be a responsible member of the scientific community.

\textbf{Omitted Variable Bias in R}

The file \texttt{htv.RData} contains data from the 1991 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, provided by Wooldridge. All people in the sample are males age 26 to 34. The data is interesting here, because it includes education, stored in the variable \texttt{educ}, and also a score on an ability test, stored in the variable \texttt{abil}.

Assume that the true model is,

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/wage_system.png}

\textbf{Questions:}

1- Are we able to \emph{directly} measure ability? If so, how would you propose to measure it?

2- If not, what \emph{do} we measure and how is this measurement related to ability? And there is a lot of evidence to suggest that standardized tests are not a very good proxy. But for now, let's pretend that we really are measuring ability.

3- Using R, estimate (a) the true model, and (b) the regression of ability on education.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Write down the expression for what omitted variable bias would be if you couldn't measure ability.
\item
  Add this omitted variable bias to the coefficient for education to see what it would be.
\end{itemize}

4- Now evaluate your previous result by fitting the model, \[wage = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 educ + w\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the coefficient for the relationship between education and wages match what you estimated earlier?
\item
  Why or why not?
\end{itemize}

5- Reflect on your results:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What does the direction of omitted variable bias suggest about OLS estimates of returns to education?
\item
  What does this suggest about the reported statistical significance of education?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion-4}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-4}}

\textbf{Status Update}
You have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You run 7 different t-tests, one for posts on Monday (versus all other days), or for Tuesday (versus all other days), etc. Only the test for Sunday is significant, with a p-value of .045, so you throw out the other tests.

Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts? (How can you address this situation responsibly when you publish your results?)

\textbf{Such Update}
As before, you have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You do a little EDA and notice that Sunday seems to have more ``status updates'' than all other days, so you recode your ``day of the week'' variable into a binary one: Sunday = 1, All other days = 0. You run a t-test and get a p-value of .045. Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Funday}
Suppose researcher A tests if Monday has an effect (versus all other days), Researcher B tests Tuesday (versus all other days), and so forth. Only Researcher G, who tests Sunday finds a significant effect with a p-value of .045. Only Researcher G gets to publish her work. If you read the paper, should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Repentence}
What if researcher G above is a sociologist that chooses to measure the effect of Sunday based on years of observing the way people behave on weekends? Researcher G is not interested in the other tests, because Sunday is the interesting day from her perspective, and she wouldn't expect any of the other tests to be significant.

\textbf{Decreasing Effect Sizes}
Many observers have noted that as studies yielding statistically significant results are repeated, estimated effect sizes go down and often become insignificant. Why is this the case?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A data science model is:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A representation of the world built from random variables
  \item
    FOIS: ``agnostic'' models place minimal restrictions on joint distribution
  \item
    Parametric models (i.e.~MLE) are models based on a family of distributions.
  \item
    \(f_{Y|X}(y|\mathbf{x}) \sim g(y, \mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\theta})\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{estimation-1}{%
\section{Estimation}\label{estimation-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We have the tools to use data to infer information about the (joint) distribution
\item
  Because the joint distribution is complicated, we'll usually estimate simpler summaries of the joint distribution -- e.g.~\(E[X]\), \(V[X]\), \(E[Y|X]\), \(Cov[X,Y]\)
\item
  There are a number of techniques that you can use to develop an estimator for a parameter. These techniques vary in terms of the principle used to arrive at the estimator and the strength of the assumptions needed to support it.
\item
  However, all of these estimators are statistics meaning they are functions of the data \(\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n\)

\item
  What is the goal of estimating a parameter? Why is this something that we are interested in as data scientists?
\item
  In your own words, describe how the method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate the unknown parameters.
\item
  Why does a likelihood function have a \(\Pi\) (product operator) within it?
\item
  Is it possible to estimate using maximum likelihood without writing down a model for the data?
\item
  What happens if your model for the data is wrong? Are your estimates for the parameters ``incorrect''? Or, are they ``correct'' within the context of the model that you've written down?

\hypertarget{optimization-in-r}{%
\section{Optimization in R}\label{optimization-in-r}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The method of maximum likelihood requires an optimization routine.
\item
  For a few very simple probability models, a closed-form solution exists and the MLE can be derived by hand. (This is also \emph{potentially} the case for OLS regression.)
\item
  But, instead lets use some machine learning to find the estimates that maximize the likelihood function.
\item
  There are many optimizers (e.g.~\texttt{optimize}, and \texttt{optim}). \texttt{optimize} is the simplest to use, but only works in one dimension.

  Suppose that a firm's profit from selling a product is related to price, \(p\), and cost, \(c\), as follows:
\end{itemize}

\[ 
\text{profit} = (p - p^2) - c + 100
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explain how you would use calculus to find the maximizing price. Assume that cost is fixed.
\item
  What is the firms revenue as \texttt{p=0,\ cost\ =\ 2}? What is it at \texttt{p=10,\ cost\ =\ 2}?
\item
  Create a plot with the following characteristics:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    On the x-axis is a sequence (\texttt{seq()}) of prices from {[}0, 10{]}.
  \item
    On the y-axis is the revenue as a function of those prices. Hold cost constant at \texttt{c=2}.\\
  \item
    What does the best price seem to be?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Solve this numerically in \emph{R}, using the \emph{optimize()} function.

  \item
    Take note: using the default arguments, will \texttt{optimize} try to find a maximum or a minimum?

This exercise is meant to demonstrate what the confidence level in a confidence interval represents. We will assume a standard normal population distribution and simulate what happens when we draw a sample and compute a confidence interval.

Your task is to complete the following function so that it,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}

\item
  simulates and stores\texttt{}n draws from a standard normal distribution
\item
  based on those draws, computes a valid confidence interval with confidence level \(\alpha\), a parameter that you pass to the function.
\end{enumerate}

Your function should return a vector of length 2, containing the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval.

\[
CI_{\alpha} = \overline{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(CI_\alpha\) is the confidence interval that you're seeking to produce
\item
  \(\overline{X}\) is the sample average,\\
\item
  \(t_{\alpha/2}\) is your critical value (accessible through \texttt{qt}),
\item
  and \(s\) is your sample standard deviation. Notice that you'll need each of these pieces in the code that you're about to write.

  Suppose you run a single study. Based on what you've just written above, why is it incorrect to say that, ``There is a 95\% probability that the true mean is inside this (single) confidence interval''?

\section{Maximum Likelihood Example: Printers}\label{maximum-likelihood-example-printers}}

\textbf{Part I}

Suppose that you've got a particular sequence of values: \({1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\) that indicate whether a printer any particular time you try to print.

You have data from the last 10 times you tried.

\textbf{Question}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the probability (\(p\)) that the printer jams on the next print job?
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Part II}

The data resembles draws from a Bernoulli distribution.

However, even if we want to model this as a Bernoulli distribution, we do not know the value of the parameter, \(p\).

1- Define your random variable.

2- Write down the likelihood function

3- If it will make the math easier, log the likelihood function.

4- \emph{Path 1:} Maximize the likelihood using calculus

5- \emph{Path 2:} Maximize using numeric methods.
