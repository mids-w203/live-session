"],["blooms-taxonomy.html", "Bloom’s Taxonomy", " Bloom’s Taxonomy An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one level of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning. In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session. Remember A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts. Understand A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept is, or why the concept works in the way that it does. Apply A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem. Analyze A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be. Evaluate A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals. Create A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.

Why do we need a random variable to represent blood pressure? Why can’t we make predictions about blood pressure without random variables? We can either conduct this as a breakout activity, or as a whole-class discussion. We can describe people’s past blood pressure. But, as statisticians we don’t have information about the atoms in their bloodstream; the exact location (and amount) of plaque or how much salt they’ve eaten in a day. We need to create a model that we can use that captures as much of the real world as is useful. In this case, the probability model has very little to do with the blood or their arteries. We’re replacing something that is real (the blood) with something that is “made up” the probability model, but this is useful!

What sample space, \\(\\Omega\\), is appropriate to represent this scenario? Is \\(\\Omega\\) a finite or an infinite set? Is it countable or uncountable? If the police department happens to care only about the number of crashes during the six-hour observation period, what random variable \\(X\\) would represent this summary? Can you describe the range of your \\(X\\)? Is it finite or infinite? Is your \\(X\\) a discrete or a continuous random variable? This example motivates us to move our focus from the sample space to random variables. The sample space may sometimes be very large or may be overcrowded with unnecessary details that must be eluded in our statistical summary. 2.3.1 Discrete &amp; Continuous Random Variables Suppose \\(X\\) is a random variable that describes the time a student spends on w203 homework 1. If you have only granular measurement – i.e. the number of nights spent working on the homework – is this discrete or continuous? If you have the number of hours, is it discrete or continuous? If you have the number of seconds? Or milliseconds? Is it possible that \\(P(X = a) = 0\\) for every point \\(a\\)? For example, that \\(P(X = 3600) = 0\\).

Here’s how we take a single draw from a normal distribution with a specific set of features: rnorm(n = 1, mean = 2, sd = 1) ## [1] 1.884336 2.4.3 Repeating the Experiment We want to rerun that experiment 10 times. We take a draw, then rewind time, clear our memory and start over with fresh randomness. To do this in R, an easy way is with the replicate() function. Change the code below so that it repeats the experiment above 10 times, then use hist() to display a plot of the result. simulation &lt;- replicate( n = 10, # should you change this line? expr = 1 + .2 # or this line? ) simulation ## [1] 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 2.4.4 Better Visualization Here’s some fancy ggplot code to draw a nice histogram of the result, along with the true density.

Pick better value with `binwidth`. 2.4.5 Repeating the Experiment (Questions) What happens to your plot as you increase the number of draws from 10 to 100 to 1000…? In your own words, what is the difference between the distribution and the sample you are taking? 2.4.6 The Visualization Trick This is a pretty useful “trick.” The repetition we’re using has no analogue in the real world – we don’t get to shake up the world like a snow globe a number of times in a row to see what it does. But, when we say “take a draw from the distribution” another way to say this is that we’re simulating the random variable. 2.4.7 Apply the Visualization Trick, Part I How can the visualization trick help us? Here’s a problem: Suppose \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent normal random variables, both with mean 2 and standard deviation 1. Say \\(Z = X + Y\\). What is the distribution of \\(Z\\)? We could do some math to compute the density function of \\(Z\\), but it’s actually quite messy. Instead, let’s use the visualization trick to get an approximate idea. 2.4.8 Apply the Visualization Trick, Part II First, write an R function to simulate a single draw from \\(Z\\). Simulate a draw for \\(X\\). Simulate a draw \\(Y\\). Return the sum of the previous draws. rz &lt;- function() { 2 # Replace with your code } Use the previous code to repeat this experiment 10,000 times and plot a histogram. See if you can guess what the the distribution is, and plot your guess on the histogram. 2.4.9 How is simulation useful? Are there situations that you think simulation of this sort might be useful?
