    "text": "1.2 Course Learning Objectives\nAt this point in the course, there is so much that is before us! As we settle in to study for the semester, it is useful to have a point of view of where we’re trying to go, and what we are going to see along the way.\nAllow a justification by analogy:\n\nSuppose that you decide that you would like to be a chef – all of the time watching cooking shows has revealed to you that this is your life’s true calling – and so you enroll in a culinary program.\nOne does not begin such a program by baking croissants and souffle. They begin the program with knife skills, breaking down ingredients and the basic techniques that build up to produce someone who is not a cook, but a chef – someone who can combine ingredients and techniques to produce novel ideas.\nAt the same time, however, one has not gone to school just to become a cucumber slicer. The knife skills are instrumental to the eventual goal – of being a chef – but not the goal itself.\n\nAt the beginning of the program, we’re teaching these core, fundamental skills. How to read and reason with mathematical objects, how to use conditional probability with the goal of producing a model, and eventually, eventually to create novel work as a data scientist.\nAt the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\n1.2.1 Understand the building blocks of probability theory that prepare learners for the study of statistical models\n\nUnderstand the mathematical objects of probability theory and be able to apply their properties.\nUnderstand how high-level concepts from calculus and linear algebra are related to common procedures in data science.\nTranslate between problems that are defined in business or research terms into problems that can be solved with math.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Understand and apply statistical models in common situations\n\nUnderstand the theory of statistics to prepare students for inferrential statements.\nUnderstand model parameters and high level strategies to estimate them: means, least squares, and maximum likelihood.\nChoose an appropriate statistic, and conduct a hypothesis test in the Neyman-Pearson framework.\nInterpret the results of a statistical test, including statistical significance and practical significance.\nRecognize limitations of the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing framework and be a conscientious participant in the scientific process\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Analyze a research question using a linear regression framework\n\nExplore and wrangle data with the intention of understanding the information and relationships that are (and are not) present\nIdentify the goals of your analysis\nBuild a model that achieves the goals of an analysis\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Interpret the results of a model and communicate them in manner appropriate to the audience\n\nIdentify their audience and report process and findings in a manner appropriate to that audience.\nConstruct regression oriented reports that provide insight for stakeholders.\nConstruct technical documents of process and code for collaboration and reproducability with peer data scientists.\nRead, understand, and assess the claims that are made in technical, regression oriented reports\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Contribute proficient, basic work, using industry standard tools and coding practices to a modern data science team.\nDemonstrate programming proficiency by translating statistical problems into code. 1. Understand and incorporate best practices for coding style and data carpentry 2. Utilize industry standard tooling for collaboration",

You!\nIdentity shapes how people approach and understand their world.\nWe would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course. We each have been fortunate to be able to study, but we want to acknowledge that the education system in the US has systematically benefited the hegemonic groups and marginalized others voices.\nEvery one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are. We want to see a field of data scientists who embrace each others voices, and respects people for the identies that they hold.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’ve never taken a stats class before, or if you’re reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome.\nIt doesn’t matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless.\nThe color of your skin doesn’t matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University’s Principles of Community.",

    "text": "1.6 Probability Theory\nProbability\nProbability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually every other model you’ll ever use as a data scientist.\n\n\n\ntold you this would be spacey\n\n\nIn this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it.\nIn introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes’ Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you’ll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform – squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull – variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful information from your data.\nAs you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely next word or words that someone might type?\nBeyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner.\nFirst, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a much fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e. compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn’t clearly fit into a box, there’s no way to move forward.\n\nStatistics like this is not fun.\n\nIn the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you’re able to learn why certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven’t seen before.\nThe second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements nearly always developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language.",

Then, \\((\\Omega, S, P)\\) is a probability space if it satisfies the following:\n\nNon-negativity: \\(\\forall A \\in S, P(A) \\geq 0\\), where \\(P(A)\\) is finite and real.\nUnitarity: \\(P(\\Omega)=1\\).\nCountable additivity: if \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots \\in S\\) are pairwise disjoint, then\n\n\\[\nP(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) = \\sum_{i}P(A_{i})\n\\]\n\nThere is a lot going on in this definition!\nFirst things first, these are the axioms of probability (read aloud in the booming voice of a god).\nThis means that these are things that we begin from, sort of the foundational principles of the entire system of reasoning that we are going to use. In the style of argument that we’re going to make, these are things that are sort of off-limits to question. Instead, these serve as the grounding assumptions, and we see what happens as we flow forward from these statements.\nSecond, and importantly, from these axioms there are a very large set of things that we can build. The first set of things that we will build are probability statements about atomic outcomes (Theorem 1.1.4 in the book), and collections of events. But, these statements, are not the only thing that we’re limited to. We can also build Frequentist Statistics, and Bayesian Statistics and Language Models.\nIn many ways, these axioms are the fundamental particles that hold our system of probabilistic reasoning together.

With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are closer to the truth than predictions made without this information.\nThere is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function.\n\nThe beauty is that by reasoning with such general objects – the definitions that we create, and the theorems that we derive in this section of the course – produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function. We will compute several examples of specific functions to provide a chance to reason about these objects and how they “work”.\nThe tragedy is that in the “real world”, the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. Because we don’t have access to the joint density function, in later weeks we will try to produce estimates using data. The simpler the estimate, the less data we need; the fuller the representation of the joint density function we desire, the more data we need.\n\nPerhaps this is the creation myth for probability theory: in a perfect world, we can produce a perfect result.

Does this definition help you?\n\nA random variable is a function \\(X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\) such that \\(\\forall r \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: X(\\omega) \\leq r\\} \\in S\\).\n\nSomeone, please, read that without using a single “omega”, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy so serious?\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the \\(X(\\omega) \\leq r\\) feels kind of weird; why isn’t it just \\(X(\\omega) = r\\)? After all, this is a mapping from an outcome, \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) to a real number, right? So, why not just be direct about it? The answer is a real deep-dive, and one that is better suited to a formal measure theory course.\nThe short (but deeply technical) answer, is that the we use this \\(\\leq r\\) range because we’re using a Boreal \\(\\sigma\\) algebra to constrain the sets that have probability measures. Why this constraint? If we don’t weird stuff can happen. Like, real weird things: you can split a sphere into pieces and create two new spheres of equal volume from the pieces (Banch-Tarski Paradox). This is an example of a formal language allowing scholars to examine really far out implications of the theory; but, it isn’t something that we’re going to engage in this course.\n\n\nThe goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be absolutely clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student’s home language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhat are the key things that random variables allow you to accomplish?\n\nSuppose that you were going to try to make a model that predicts the probability of winning “big money” on a slot machine. Big money might be that you get 🍒🍒🍒. Can you do math with 🍒?\nSuppose that you wanted to build a chatbort that uses a language model so that you don’t have to do your homework anymore. How would you go about it? Can you do math on words or concepts?\nSuppose you want to direct class support to students in 203, but their grades are scored [A, A-, ..., C+] and features include prior statistics classes grades, also scored A, A-, ..., C+].",

    "text": "2.5 Pieces of a Random Variable\nThere are two key pieces that must exist for every random variable. What are these pieces?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of a Random Variable\n\n\n\nA random variable is a function \\(X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\) such that \\(\\forall r \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega\\}: X(\\omega) \\leq r\\} \\in S\\).\n\n\nThe new piece is provided to us in Definition 1.2.1 Random Variable (on page 16). The older piece (from last week) that is now useful is a part of the Kolmogorov Axiom, the probabilty triple: \\((\\Omega, S, P)\\) where \\(\\Omega\\) is a sample space, \\(S\\) is an event space, and \\(P\\) is a probability-measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a random variable is simple and discrete. For concreteness, you could think of this random variable as the answer to the question, “Is the grass wet outside?”.\n\nWhat is the sample space?\nWhat is a sensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values?\nWhat is a sensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values? (A student well-seasoned in Maths might use (and define for the rest of the class) the concept of a bijective function).\nIf you simply had the values that the random variable function maps to are you guaranteed to be able to describe the entire sample space? Why or why not?\nHow would you go about determining the probability mass function for this random variable?\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Functions of Functions\n\nWhy do we say that random variables are functions? Is there some useful property of these being functions rather than any other quantity? What else could they be if not a function?\n\nWhat about a function of a random variable, which is a function of a function.\n\nLet \\(g : U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be some function, where \\(X(\\Omega) \\subseteq U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}\\). Then, if \\(g \\circ X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a random variable, we say that \\(g\\) is a function of X and write \\(g(X)\\) to denote the random variable \\(g \\circ X\\).\n\nIf a random variable is a function from the real world, or the sample space, or the outcome space to a real number, then what does it mean to define a function of a random variable?\n\nAt what point does this function work? Does this function change the sample space that is possible to observe? Or, does this function change the real-number that each outcome points to?\n\n\nSuppose that you are doing some image processing work. To keep things simple, that you are doing image classification in the style of the MNIST dataset.\n\nCan someone describe what this task is trying to accomplish?\nHas anyone done work like this?\n\nHowever, suppose that rather than having good clean indicators for whether a pixel is on or off, instead you have weak indicators – there’s a lot of grey. A lot of the cells are marked in the range \\(0.2 - 0.3\\).\n\nHow might creating a function that re-maps this grey into more extreme values help your model?\nIs it possible to “blur” events that are in the outcome space? Does this “blurring” meet the requirements of a function of a random variable, as provided above?\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Probability Density Functions and Cumulative Distribution Functions\n\nWhat is a probability mass function?\nWhat do the Kolmogorov Axioms mean must be true about any probability mass function (pmf)?\n\n\nYou should try driving in Berkeley some time. It is a trip! Without being deliberately ageist, the city is full of ageing hippies driving beater Subaru Outbacks and making what seem to be stochastic right-or-left turns to buy incense, pottery, or just sourdough bread.\nSuppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you’re hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearly with each block that you cross.\nFinally, campus provides you with the safety reports from last year, and reports that there were 55 student-Subaru incidents last year, out of 10,000 student-crosswalk crossings.\n\nWhat is the pmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident as you walk across these 10 blocks? What sample space, \\(\\Omega\\) is appropriate to represent this scenario?\nSuppose that you don’t leave your house – this is a remote program after all! What is your cumulative probability of being involved in a student-subaru incident?\nWhat is the cumulative probability cmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident?\nSuppose that you live three blocks from campus, but your classmate lives five blocks from campus. What is the difference in the cumulative probability?\nHow would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk closer to campus? That is, suppose that you start 10 blocks away from campus, and are walking to get closer. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way to campus increasing or decreasing as you get closer to campus?\nHow would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk further from campus? That is, suppose that you start on campus, and you’re walking to a bar after classes. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way away from campus increasing or decreasing as you get further from campus?",

    "text": "2.7 Moving Between PDF and CDF\nThe book defines pmf and cmf first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the cdf, which is the cumulative distribution function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it.\nMore importantly for this course, in Definition 1.2.15 the book defines the relationship between cdf and pdf in the following way:\n\nFor a continuous random variable \\(X\\) with CDF \\(F\\), the probability density function of \\(X\\) is\n\\[\n  f(x) = \\left. \\frac{d F(u)}{du} \\right|_{u=x}, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\nThe implies, further, that for a random variable \\(X\\) with PDF \\(f\\), the cumulative density function of \\(X\\) is:\n\\[\nF(x) = \\int f(x) dx, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n\\]\n\n\nHow does this definition, which relates pdf and cdf by a means of differentiation and integration, fit with the ideas that we just developed in the context of walking to and from campus?\n\n\nSuppose that you learn than a particular random variable, \\(X\\) has the following function that describes its pdf, \\(f_{x}(x) = \\frac{1}{10}x\\). Also, suppose that you know that the smallest value that is possible for this random variable to obtain is 0.\n\nWhat is the CDF of \\(X\\)?\nWhat is the maximum possible value that \\(x\\) can obtain?

    "section": "2.8 Joint Density",
    "text": "2.8 Joint Density\nWorking with a single random variable helps to develop our understanding of how to relate the different features of a pdf and a cdf through differentiation and integration. However, there’s not really that much else that we can do; and, there is probably very little in our professional worlds that would look like a single random variable in isolation.\nWe really start to get to something useful when we consider joint density functions. Joint density functions describe the probability that both of two random variables. That is, if we are working with random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then the joint density function provides a probability statement for \\(P(X \\cap Y)\\).\nIn this course, we might typically write this joint density function as \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f(\\cdot)\\) where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the actual function that represents the joint probability. The \\(f(\\cdot)\\) means, essentially, “some function” where we just have not designated the specifics of the function; you might think of this as a generic function.\n\n2.8.1 Example: Uniform Joint Density\nSuppose that we know that two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are jointly uniformly distributed within the the support \\(x \\in [0,4], y \\in [0,4]\\). We have a requirement, imposed by the Kolmogorov Axioms that all probabilities must be non-zero, and that the total probability across the whole support must be one.\n\nCan you use these facts to determine answers to the following:\n\nWhat kind of shape does this joint pdf have?\nWhat is the specific function that describes this shape?\nIf you draw this shape on three axes, and \\(X\\), and \\(Y\\), and a \\(P(X,Y)\\), what does this plot look like?\nHow do you get from the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \\(X\\)?\nHow do you get form the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \\(Y\\)?\nHow do you get from these marginal density functions of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) back to the joint density? Is this always possible?\n\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Examples: Thinking Through Many Plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.3 Triangle Math\nAfter considering the intuition for the triangle distribution, do the following: Write down the function that accords with the figure that you’re seeing above.1\n\nWhat is a full statement of the PDF of this image?\nWhat is the marginal distribution of \\(X\\), \\(f_{X}(x)\\)?\nWhat is the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\), \\(f_{Y}(y)\\)?\nUsing the definition of independence, are \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) independent of each other?\nWhat is the CDF of \\(X\\), \\(F_{X}(x)\\)?\n\n\n\n2.8.4 Saddle Sores\nSuppose that you know that two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are jointly distributed with the following pdf:\n\\[\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    a * (x^{2} - y^{2} + 1), & 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, 0 &lt; y &lt; 1 \\\\\n    0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis joint pdf is similar to the pdf that you can visualize above, under the distribution called “saddle”. The difference between this function and the image above is that the function bounds the with support of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) on the range \\([0,1]\\). This is to make the math easier for us in the next step.\n\nCan you use these facts to determine the following?\n\nWhat value of \\(a\\) makes this a valid joint pdf?\nWhat is the marginal pdf of \\(x\\)? That is, what is \\(f_{x}(x)\\)?\nWhat is the conditional pdf of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\)? That is, what is \\(f_{x|y}(x,y)\\)?\nGiven these facts, would you say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are dependent or independent?\nIf the support for this joint distribution were instead \\([0,4]\\) (rather than \\([0,1]\\)), how would the shape of the distribution change?",

    "text": "2.11 Visualizing Distributions Via Simulation\nTo this point in the course, we have focused on concepts in “the population” with no reference to samples. This is on purpose! We want to develop the theory that defines the best possible predictor if we knew everything (if we know formula of the function that maps from \\(\\omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), and we know the probability of each \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) then we know everything). Beginning in week 5 of the course, we will talk about “approximating” (which we will call estimating) this best possible predictor with a limited sample of data.\nHowever, at this point, to help build your working understanding, or intuition, for what is happening, we are going to work on a way to simulate draws from a population. In some places, people might refer to these as Monte Carlo methods – this is because the method was developed by von Neumann & Ulam during World War II, and they needed a way to talk about it using a code name. They chose Monte Carlo after a famous casino in Monaco.\n\n2.11.1 Example: The Uniform Distribution\n\nYou: “Gosh. There sure are a lot of examples that use the uniform distribution. That must be a really important statistical distribution.”\nInstructor: “Nah. Not really. We’re just using the uniform a bunch so that we don’t get too lost in doing math while we’re working with these concepts.”\n\nWe’ll start with a simple uniform distribution, but then we’ll make it a little more complex in a moment.\nWe can use R to simulate draws from a probability distribution function by providing it with the name of the distribution that we’re considering, the support of that distribution, or other features of the distribution. In the case of the uniform, the entire distribution is can be described just from it support.\nSo, suppose that you had a uniform distribution that had positive probability on the range \\([1.1, 4.3]\\). Why these? No particular reason. That is, suppose\n\\[\nf_{X}(x) =\n  \\begin{cases}\n    a & 1.1 \\leq x \\leq 4.3 \\\\\n    0 & otherwise\n  \\end{cases}\n\\]\nWhat does this distribution “look like”? Because it is a uniform, you might have a sense that it will be a horizontal line. But, what is the height of that line? Aha! We could do the math to figure it out, or we could generate an approximation using a simulation.\nIn the code below, we are going to create an object called samples_uniform that stores the results of the runif function call.\n\nsamples_uniform &lt;- runif(n=1000, min=1.1, max=4.3)\n\nWhat is happening inside runif?\nWhen you’re writing you own code, you can pull up the documentation for this (and any) function using a question mark, i.e. ?, followed by the function name – ?runif.\nBut, we can speed this up slightly by simply telling you that n is the number of samples to take from the population; min is the low-end of the support, and max is the high-end of the support.\nIf we look into this object, we can see the results of the function call. Below, we will show the first \\(20\\) elements of the samples_uniform object.\n\nsamples_uniform[1:20]\n\n [1] 2.234654 3.208821 2.230534 4.134750 4.004317 3.188793 1.753870 3.559672\n [9] 2.429026 2.947665 3.912242 1.143845 3.854465 2.023560 2.952931 3.728450\n[17] 2.629490 1.708903 3.068128 2.338122\n\n\n(Notice that R is a \\(1\\) index language (python is a zero-index language).)\nWith this object created, we can plot a density of the data and then learn from this histogram what the pdf looks like.\n\nplot_full_data &lt;- ggplot() + \n  aes(x=1:length(samples_uniform), y=samples_uniform) + \n  geom_point()  + \n  labs(\n    title = 'Showing the Data', \n    y     = 'Sample Value', \n    x     = 'Index')\n\nplot_density &lt;- ggplot() + \n  aes(x=samples_uniform) + \n  geom_density(bw=0.1)   + \n  labs(\n    title = 'Showing the PDF', \n    y     = 'Probability of Drawing Value', \n    x     = 'Sample Value')\n\n(plot_full_data | (plot_density + coord_flip())) / \n  plot_density \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting. From what we can see here, there does not appear to be any discernible pattern. This leaves us with two options: either, we might reduce the resolution that we’re using to view this pattern, or we might take more samples and hold the resolution constant. Below, two different plots show these differing approaches, and are very explicit about the code that creates them.\n\nsamples_uniform_moar &lt;- runif(n = 1000000, min = 1.1, max = 4.3)\n\n\nplot_low_res &lt;- ggplot()   + \n  aes(x = samples_uniform) + \n  geom_density(bw = 0.1)   + \n  lims(y = c(0,0.4))       + \n  labs(title = 'Low Res, Low Data')\n\nplot_high_res &lt;- ggplot()       + \n  aes(x = samples_uniform_moar) + \n  geom_density(bw = 0.01)       + \n  lims(y = c(0,0.4))            + \n  labs(title = 'High Res, More Data')\n\nplot_low_res | plot_high_res\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.11.2 Example: The Normal Distribution\nFolks might have some prior beliefs about the Normal distribution. Don’t worry, we’ll cover this later in the course. But, this is the distribution that you have in mind when you’re thinking of a “bell curve”.\nWe can use the same method to visualize a normal distribution as we did for a uniform distribution. In this case, we would issue the call rnorm, together with the population parameters that define the population. At this point in the course, we do not expect that you will know these (and, actually memorizing these facts are not a core focus of the course), but you can look them up if you like. Truthfully, statistics wikipedia is very good.\nDo do you notice anything about the runif and the rnorm calls that we have identified? Both seem to name the distribution: \\(unif \\approx uniform\\) and \\(norm \\approx normal\\), but prepened with a r? This is for “random draw”.\nBase R is loaded with a pile of basic statistics distributions, which you can look into using ?distributions.\n\nsamples_normal &lt;- rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 18, sd = 4)\n\nLike before, we could look at the first \\(20\\) of these samples.\n\nsamples_normal[1:20]\n\n [1] 25.98688 14.16542 26.92970 13.69004 10.07124 10.60580 17.57015 15.92421\n [9] 20.83161 20.26717 18.16140 14.18662 25.86656 12.39303 15.31269 17.63924\n[17] 12.54036 20.33083 22.81328 14.53269\n\n\nAnd, from here we could visualize this distribution.\n\nggplot() + \n  aes(x = samples_normal) + \n  geom_density() + \n  labs(title = 'Visualization of this Normal Distribution')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.11.2.1 Combining This Ability\n\nConsider three random variables \\(A, B, C\\). Suppose,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}    \n  A & \\sim Uniform(min=1.1, max=4.3) \\\\     \n  B & \\sim Normal(mean=18, sd=4)     \\\\     \n  C &= A + B  \\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAnd, suppose that \\(B\\) is a random variable that is described by the normal density that we considered earlier. Suppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent of each other.\nFinally, suppose that \\(C = A + 2B\\).\nWhat does \\(C\\) look like?\n\nAlthough this is a simple function applied to a random variable – a legal move – the math would be tedious. What if, instead, one used this simulation method to get a sense for the distribution?\n\nsamples_A &lt;- runif(n = 10000, min = 1.1, max = 4.3)\nsamples_B &lt;- rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 18, sd = 4)\n\nsamples_C &lt;- samples_A + samples_B\n\n\nplot_C &lt;- ggplot() + \n  aes(x = samples_C) + \n  geom_density()\n\nplot_C_and_A_and_B &lt;- ggplot()   + \n  geom_density(aes(x = samples_A), color = '#003262') + \n  geom_density(aes(x = samples_B), color = '#FDB515') + \n  geom_density(aes(x = samples_C), color = 'darkred')\n\nplot_C_and_A_and_B",

    "text": "3.2 Class Announcements\nWhere have we come from, and where are we going?\n\n3.2.1 What is in the rearview mirror?\n\n\nStatisticians create a population model to represent the world; random variables are the building blocks of such a model.\nWe can describe the distribution of a random variable using:\n\nA CDF for all random variables\nA PMF for discrete random variables\nA PDF for continuous random variables\n\nWhen we have multiple random variables,\n\nThe joint PMF/PDF describes how they behave together\nThe marginal PMF/PDF describes one variable in isolation\nThe conditional PMF/PDF describes one variable given the value of another\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Today’s Lesson\nWhat might seem frustrating about this probability theory system of reasoning is that we are building a castle in the sky – a fiction. We’re supposing that there is some function that describes the probability that values are generated. In reality, there is no such generative function; it is extremely unlikely (though we’ll acknowledge that it is possible) that the physical reality we believe we exist within is just a complex simulation that has been programmed with functions by some unknown designer.\nEspecially frustrating is that we’re supposing this function, and then we’re further saying,\n\n“If only we had this impossible function; and if only we also had the ability to take an impossible derivative of this impossible function, then we could…”\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Single number summaries of a single random variable\nBut, here’s the upshot!\nWhat we are doing today is laying the baseline for models that we will introduce next week. Here, we are going to suggest that there are radical simplifications that we can produce that hold specific guarantees, no matter how complex the function that we’re reasoning about.\nIn particular, in one specific usage of the term best we will prove that the Expectation operation is the best one-number summary of any distribution. To do so, we will define a term, variance, which is the squared deviations from the expectation of a variable that describes how “spread out” is a variable. Then, we will define a concept that is the mean squared error that is the square of the distance between a model prediction and a random variable’s realization. The key realization is that when the model predicts the expectation, then the MSE is equal to the variance of the random variable, which is the smallest possible value it could realize.\n\n\n3.2.2.2 Single number summaries of relationships between random variables\nAlthough the single number summaries are incredibly powerful, that’s not enough for today’s lesson! We’re also going to suggest that we can create a measure of linear dependence between two variables that we call the “covariance”, and a related, re-scaled version of this relationship that is called the correlation.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Future Attractions\n\nA predictor is a function that provides a value for one variable, given values of some others.\nUsing our summary tools, we will define a predictor’s error and then minimize it.\nThis is a basis for linear regression",

    "text": "4.4 Roadmap\n\n4.4.1 Rearview Mirror\nOver the past three weeks, we have talked about how statisticians approach the world, using probability theory to help them make sense of the missing information in the world. This probability theory allows for very general representations of the world; and, if we had the functions that defined the probability distributions, we could do a lot! But, because we don’t live in a simulation (probably…) we don’t have access to the actual functions that describe the probability of events occurring.\nWe can summarize complex random variables in ways that are useful. We can characterize central tendency using the concept of expected value which is the probability weighted “average” of the outcomes. While there are lots of other ways to characterize central tendency, expectation has some nice properties, namely, that it minimizes mean squared error and also that it is part of the representation of variance. Variance is a measure of dispersion of a random variable, or “how far away from the center” outcomes might occur. It is defined as the probability weighted “average” of the squared deviation. Finally, covariance is a measure of linear dependency between two random variables, and it has a form that is remarkably similar to variance.\n\n\n4.4.2 This week\n\nWe look at situations with one or more “input” random variables, and one “output.”\nConditional expectation summarizes the output, given values for the inputs.\nThe conditional expectation function (CEF) is a predictor – a function that yields a value for the output, give values for the inputs.\nThe best linear predictor (BLP) summarizes a relationship using a line / linear function.\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Coming Attractions\n\nOLS regression is a workhorse of modern statistics, causal analysis, etc\n\nIt is also the basis for many other models in classical stats and machine learning\n\nThe target that OLS estimates is exactly the BLP, which we’re learning about this week.",

As a breakout group, ride shotgun with us as we prove that the conditional expectation is the function that produces the smallest possible Mean Squared Error.\nSpecifically, you group’s task is to justify every transition from one line to the next using concepts that we have learned in the course: definitions, theorems, calculus, and algebraic operations.\n\n\n\n4.7.2 The pudding (aka: “Where the proof is”)\nWe need to find such function \\(g(X): \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) that gives the smallest mean squared error.\nFirst, let MSE be defined as it is in Definition 2.1.22.\n\nFor a random variable \\(X\\) and constant \\(c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), the mean squared error of \\(X\\) about \\(c\\) is \\(E[(x-c)^2]\\).\n\nSecond, let us note that since \\(g(X)\\) is just a function that maps onto \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), that for some particular value of \\(X=x\\), \\(g(X)\\) maps onto a constant value.\n\nDeriving a Function to Minimize MSE\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  E[(Y - g(X))^2|X]\n      &= E[Y^2 - 2Yg(X) + g^2(X)|X]                                \\\\\n      &= E[Y^2|X] + E[-2Yg(X)|X] + E[g^2(X)|X]                     \\\\\n      &= E[Y^2|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)E[1|X]                     \\\\\n      &= (E[Y^2|X] - E^2[Y|X]) + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)) \\\\\n      &= V[Y|X] + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X))                \\\\\n      &= V[Y|X] + (E[Y|X] - g(X))^2                                \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNotice too that we can use the Law of Iterated Expectations to do something useful.

This means that OLS regression produces estimates of the BLP that have known convergence properties.\nThird, we’re going combine the frequentist testing framework with OLS estimation to produce a full regression testing framework.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3.2 Where We’ve Been – Random Variables and Probability Theory\nStatisticians create a model (also known as the population model) to represent the world. This model exists as joint probability densities that govern the probabilities that any series of events occurs at the same time. This joint probability of outcomes can be summarized and described with lower-dimensional summaries like the expectation, variance, covariance. While the expectation is a summary that contains information on about one marginal distribution (i.e. the outcome we are interested in) we can produce predictive models that update, or condition the expectation based on other random variables. This summary, the conditional expectation is the best possible (measured in terms of minimizing mean squared error) predictor of an outcome. We might simplify this conditional expectation predictor in many ways; the most common is to simplify to the point that the predictor is constrained to be a line or plane. This is known as the Best Linear Predictor.\n\n\n5.1.3.3 Where we Are\n\nWe want to fit models – use data to set their parameter values.\nA sample is a set of random variables\nSample statistics are functions of a sample, and they are random variables\nUnder iid and other assumptions, we get useful properties:\n\nStatistics may be consistent estimators for population parameters\nThe distribution of sample statistics may be asymptotically normal",

    "section": "5.2 Key Terms and Assumptions",
    "text": "5.2 Key Terms and Assumptions\n\n5.2.1 IID\nWe use an abbreviation for the sampling process that under girds our frequentist statistics. That abbreviation, IID, while short, contains two powerful requirements of our data sampling process.\n\nIID sampling is:\n\nIndependent. The first I in the abbreviation, this independence requirement is similar to the independence concept that we’ve used in the probability theory section of the course. When samples are independent, the result of any one sample is not informative about the value of any of the other samples.\nIdentically Distributed. The ID in the abbreviation, this requirement means that all samples are drawn from the same distribution.\n\n\nIt might be tempting to imagine that IID samples are just “random samples”, but it is worth noting that IID sampling has the two specific requirements noted above, and that these requirements are more stringent than a “randomness” criteria.\nWhen we are thinking about IID samples, and evaluating whether the sample do, in point of fact, meet both of the requirements, it is crucial to make an explicit statement about the reference population that is under consideration.\n\nFor example, suppose that you were interested in learning about life-satisfaction and your reference population are the peoples who live in the United States. Further, suppose that you decide to produce an estimate of this using a sample drawn from UC Berkeley undergraduate students during RRR week? There are several flaws in this design:\n\n\nThere is a key research design issue: a sample drawn from Berkeley undergraduates is going to be essentially uninformative of a US resident reference population!\nThere is a key statistical issue: the population of Berkeley undergraduates are not really an independent sample from the entire US resident reference population. Once you learn the age of someone from the Berkeley student population, you can make an conditional guess about the age of the next sample that will be closer than was possible before the first sample. The same goes for life-satisfaction: When you learn about the life-satisfaction from the first undergrad (who is miserable because they have their Stat 140 final coming up) while they are studying for their finals) you can make a conditionally better guess about the satisfaction of the next undergrad.\n\nNotice that these violations of the IID requirements only arise because our reference population is the US resident population. If, instead, the reference population were “Berkeley undergrads” then the sampling process would satisfy the requirements of an IID process.\n\n\nHow, or why, can a change in the reference population make an identical sampling process move from one that we can consider IID to one that we cannot consider IID?\n\n\n\n5.2.1.1 It this IID?\n\nFor each of the following scenarios, is the IID assumption plausible?\n\nCall a random phone number. If someone answers, interview all persons in the household. Repeat until you have data on 100 people.\nCall a random phone number, interview the person if they are over 30.

    "text": "5.5 Estimator Property: Consistency\nFoundations makes another of their jokes when they write, on page 105,\n\n“Consistency is a simple notion: if we had enough data, the probability that our estimate \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) would be far from the truth, \\(\\theta\\), would be small.”\n\n\nHow do we determine if a particular estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is a consistent estimator for our parameter of interest?\nThere are at least two ways:\n\nThe estimator is unbiased, and has a sampling variance that decreases as we add data; or,\nWe can use Chebyshev’s to place a bound on the estimator, showing that as we add data, the estimator converges in probability to \\(\\theta\\).\n\n\nThe first notion of convergence requires an understanding of sampling variance:\nThe sampling variance of an estimator is a statement about how much dispersion due to random sampling, is present in the estimator. We defined the variance of a random variable to be \\(E\\left[(X - E[X])^{2}\\right]\\), The sampling variance uses this same definition, but we work with it slightly differently when we are considering sampling variance.\nIn particular, when we are considering sampling variance, we do not typically got as far as actually computing the variance of the underlying random variable? Why? Because, if we’re working in a sampling scenario, it is unlikely that we have access to the underlying function that governs the PDF of the random variable.\nInstead, we typically start from a statement of the estimator that is under consideration, and apply the variance operator against that estimator. Consider, for example, forming a statement about the sampling variance of the sample average.\nLet \\(\\overline{X} \\equiv\\) “sample average” \\(\\equiv \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\\) be the normal form of the sample average.\nEarlier, we proved that \\(\\overline{X}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(E[X]\\).\n\nWhat is the sampling variance of the sample average?\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nUsing the statement that you have just produced, would you say that the sample average is a consistent estimator for the population expectation of a random variable?",

    "text": "5.6 Understanding Sampling Distributions\nHow do sampling distributions change as we add data to them? This is going to both motivate convergence, and also play forward into the Central Limit Theorem. Let’s work through an example that begins with a case that we can think through and draw ourselves. Once we feel pretty good about the very small sample, then we will rely on R to do the work when we expand the example beyond what we can draw ourselves.\n\nSuppose that \\(X\\) is a Bernoulli random variable representing an unfair coin. Suppose that the coin has a 70% chance of coming up heads: \\(P(X=1) = 0.7\\).\n\nTo begin, suppose that you take that coin, and you toss it two times: you have an iid sample of size 2, \\((X_1,X_2)\\).\nWhat is the sampling distribution of the sample average, of this sample of size two?\nOn the axes below, draw the probability distribution of \\(\\overline X = \\frac{X_1+X_2}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if you took four samples? What would the sampling distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\) look like? Draw this onto the axis above.\nExplain the difference between a population distribution and the sampling distribution of a statistic.\nWhy do we want to know things about the sampling distribution of a statistic?\n\n\nWe are going to write a function that, essentially, just wraps a built-in function with a new name and new function arguments. This is, generally, bad coding practice – because it is changing the default lexicon than a collaborator needs to be aware of – but it is useful for teaching purposes here.\n\nThe number_of_simulations argument to the toss_coin function basically just adjusts the precision of our simulation study.\nLet’s set, and keep this at \\(1000\\) simulations. But, if you’re curious, you could set this to be \\(5\\), or \\(10\\) and evaluate what happens.\n\n\ntoss_coin &lt;- function(\n    number_of_simulations=1000, \n    number_of_tosses=2, \n    prob_heads=0.7) { \n  \n  ## number of simulations is just how many times we want to re-run the experiment\n  ## number of tosses is the number of coins we're going to toss.\n  number_of_heads &lt;- rbinom(n=number_of_simulations, size=number_of_tosses, prob=prob_heads)\n  sample_average  &lt;- number_of_heads / number_of_tosses\n  return(sample_average)\n}\n\ntoss_coin(number_of_simulations=10, number_of_tosses=2, prob_heads=0.7)\n\n [1] 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.5 0.5\n\n\n\nncoins &lt;- 10\n\ncoin_result_005 &lt;- toss_coin(\n  number_of_simulations = 10000,\n  number_of_tosses = ncoins, \n  prob_heads = 0.005\n  )\n\ncoin_result_05 &lt;- toss_coin(\n  number_of_simulations = 10000,\n  number_of_tosses = ncoins, \n  prob_heads = 0.5\n  )\n\nplot_005 &lt;- ggplot() + \n    aes(x=coin_result_005) + \n    geom_histogram(bins=50) + \n    geom_vline(xintercept=0.005, color='#003262', linewidth=2)\n\nplot_05 &lt;- ggplot() + \n    aes(x=coin_result_05) + \n    geom_histogram(bins=50) + \n    geom_vline(xintercept=0.5, color='#003262', linewidth=2)\n\nplot_005 / \n  plot_05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot that you have drawn above, pick some value, \\(\\epsilon\\) that is the distance away from the true expected value of this distribution.\n\nWhat proportion of the sampling distribution is further away than \\(E[X] \\pm \\epsilon\\)?\nWhen we toss the coin only two times, we can quickly draw out the distribution of \\(\\overline{X}\\), and can form a statement about the \\(P(E[X] - \\epsilon \\leq  \\overline{X} \\leq E[X] + \\epsilon)\\).\nWhat if we toss the coin ten times? We can still use the IID nature of the coin to figure out the true \\(P(\\overline{X} = 0), P(\\overline{X} = 1), \\dots, P(\\overline{X} = 10)\\), but it is going to start to take some time. This is where we rely on the simulation to start speeding up our learning.\nAs we toss more and more coins, \\(\\overline X_{(100)} \\rightarrow \\overline X_{(10000)}\\) what will the value of \\(\\overline X\\) get closer to? What law generates this, and why does this law generate this result?",

    "text": "5.7 Write Code to Demo the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nWhen you were reading for this week, did you sense the palpable joy of the authors when they were writing about the central limit theorem?\n\nWe now preset what is often considered the most profound and important theorem in statistics.\n\nWow. What excitement.\nOn its own, the result that across a broad range of generative functions the distribution of sample averages converges in distribution to follow a normal distribution would be a statistical curiosity. Along the lines of “did you know that dinosaurs might have had feathers,” or, “avocado trees reproduce using ’protogynous dichogamy”. While these factoids might be useful on your quiz-bowl team, they don’t get us very far down the line as practicing data scientists.\nHowever, there is a very useful consequence of this convergence in distribution that we will explore in detail over the coming two weeks: because so many distributions produce sample averages that converge in distribution to a normal distribution, we can put together a testing framework for sample averages that works for an agnostic set of random variables. Wait for that next week, but know that there’s a reason that we’re as excited about this statement as we are.\n\n5.7.1 Part 1\nTo begin with, we will use fair coins that have an equal probability landing heads and tails.\n\n\nModify the function argument below so that it conduct one simulations, and in each simulation tosses ten coins, each with an equal probability of landing heads and tails. Look into the toss_coin function: is there a point that this function is producing a sample average? If so, where?\nSave values from the toss_coin function into an object, called sample_mean.\n\n\n\n# toss_coin()\n\n\nThe sample mean is a random variable – it is a function that maps from a random generative process’ sample space (the number of heads shown on dice) to the real numbers. To try to make this clear, visualize a larger number of simulations on the toss_coin function. That is, increase the number_of_simulations to be 10, or 100. and plot a histogram of the results. This is quite similar to what we have done earlier.\n\n\n# toss_coin()\n\n\nIf you replicate the simulation with ten coins enough times, will the distribution ever look normal? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Part 2\nFor this part, we’ll continue to study a fair coin.\n\nWhat happens if you change the number of coins that you’re tossing? Here, set number_of_simulations=1000, and examine what happens if you alter the number of coins that you’re tossing? Is there a point where this distribution starts to “look normal” to you? (Later in the semester, we’ll formalize a test for this “looks normal” concept).\n\n\n\n5.7.3 Part 3\n\nWhat would happen if the coin was very, very unfair? For this part, study a coin that has a prob_heads=0.01. This is an example of a highly skewed random variable.\nStart your study here tossing three coins, number_of_coins=3. What does this distribution look like?\n\n\nWhat happens as you increase the number of coins that you’re tossing? Is there a point that the distribution starts to look normal?\n\n\n\n5.7.4 Discussion Questions About the CLT\n\n\nHow does the skewness of the population distribution affect the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem? What lesson can you take for your practice of statistics?\nName a variable you would be interested in measuring that has a substantially skewed distribution.\nOne definition of a heavy tailed distribution is one with infinite variance. For example, you can use the rcauchy command in R to take draws from a Cauchy distribution, which has heavy tails. Do you think a “heavy tails” distribution will follow the CLT? What leads you to this intuition?",

Despite this unknown and unknowable population target, with some carefully written down estimators we can rely on the convergence characteristics of some estimators to produce useful, reliable results.\nWe begin with the one-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test relies on the sample average as an estimator of a population expectation. In doing so, it relies on the effectiveness of the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem to guarantee that the estimator that converges in probability to the population expectation, while also converging in distribution to a Gaussian distribution.\nThese two convergence concepts permit a data scientist to make several inferences based on data:\nThis framework begins a exceedingly important task that we must understand, and undertake when we are working as data scientists: Producing our best-estimate, communicating how we arrived at that estimate, what (if any) guarantees that estimate provides, and crucially all limitations of our estimate.",

    "text": "6.10 Data Exercise\nt-Test Micro Cheat Sheet\nIn order for a t-test to produce valid results, a set of conditions must be satisfied. While the literature refers to these as assumptions, you might do better to refer to these for yourselves as requirements. Meaning, if these requirements for the data generating process are not satisfied, the test does not produce results that hold any statistical guarantees.\n\nMetric variable: The data needs to be numeric\nIID: The data needs to be sampled using an independent, identically distributed sampling process.\nWell-behaved: The data need to demonstate no major deviations from normality, considering sample size\n\nTesting the Home Team Advantage\nThe file ./data/home_team.csv contains data on college football games. The data is provided by Wooldridge and was collected by Paul Anderson, an MSU economics major, for a term project.

We would like to test whether a home team really has an advantage over the visiting team.\n\nThe instructor will assign you to one of two teams. Team 1 will argue that the t-test is appropriate to this scenario. Team 2 will argue that the t-test is invalid. Take a few minutes to examine the data, then formulate your best argument.\n\n\nShould you perform a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test? What is the strongest argument for your answer?\n\n\n## I'm going two-tailed. \n## H0 : No effect of being home or away\n## HA : There IS some effect. \n\n\nExecute the t-test and interpret every component of the output.\n\n\nt.test(x=home_team$score_diff, mu=0, alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  home_team$score_diff\nt = -0.30781, df = 29, p-value = 0.7604\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -8.408919  6.208919\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n     -1.1 \n\nres &lt;- NA\nfor(i in 1:10000) {\n  res[i] &lt;- mean(rnorm(n=7, sd=sd(home_team$score_diff)))\n}\n\nggplot() + \n  aes(x=res) + \n  geom_density() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=mean(home_team$score_diff))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhome_team |&gt;  \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x=abs(score_diff)) + \n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean(home_team$score_diff)\n\n[1] -1.1\n\nmean((res &lt; mean(home_team$score_diff))) + mean(res &gt; abs(mean(home_team$score_diff)))\n\n[1] 0.8811\n\n\n\nBased on your output, suggest a different hypothesis that would have led to a different test result.

    "text": "7.4 Teamwork Discussion\n\n7.4.1 Working on Data Science Teams\nData science is a beautiful combination of team-work and individual-work. It provides the opportunity to work together on a data pipeline with people from all over the organization, to deal with technical, statistical, and social questions that are always interesting. While we expect that everyone on a team will be a professional, there is so much range within the pursuit of data science that projects are nearly always collaborative exercises.\nTogether as teams, we\n\nDefine research ambitions and scope\nImagine/envision the landscape of what is possible\nSupport, discuss, review and integrate individual contributions\n\nTogether as individuals we conduct the heads-down work that moves question answering forward. This might be reading papers to determine the most appropriate method to bring to bear on the question, or researching the data that is available, or understanding the technical requirements that we have to meet for this answer to be useful to our organization in real time.\nWhat is your instructor uniquely capable of? Let them tell you! But, at the same time, what would they acknowledge that others are better than them?\nSee, the thing is, because there is so much that has to be done, there literally are very, very few people who are one-stop data science shops. Instead, teams rely on collaboration and joint expertise in order to get good work done.\n\n\n7.4.2 The Problematic Psychology of Data Science\nPeople talk about the impostor syndrome: a feeling of inadequacy or interloping that is sometimes also associated with a fear of under-performing relative to the expectation of others on the team. These emotions are common through data science, academics, computer science. But, these types of emotions are also commonplace in journalism, film-making, and public speaking.\nHas anybody ever had the dream that they’re late to a test? Or, that that they’ve got to give a speech that they’re unprepared for? Does anybody remember playing an instrument as a kid and having to go to recitals? Or, play for a championship on a youth sports team? Or, go into a test two?\nWhat are the feelings associated with those events? What might be generating these feelings?\n\n\n\n7.4.3 What Makes an Effective Team?\n\nThis reading on effective teams summarizes academic research to argue:\n\n\nWhat really matters to creating an effective tema is less about who is on the team, and more about how the team works together.\n\nIn your live session, your section might take 7 minutes to read this brief. If so, please read the following sections:\n\nThe problem statement;\nThe proposed solution;\nThe framework for team effectiveness, stopping at the section titled “Tool: Help teams determine their own needs.”\n\n\n“Psychological safety refers to an individual’s perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk. It is a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive.”\n“In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.”\n\n\n\n7.4.4 We All Belong\n\nFrom your experience, can you give an example of taking a personal risk as part of a team?\n\nCan you describe your emotions when contemplating this risk?\nIf you did take the risk, how did the reactions of your teammates affect you?\n\nKnowing the circumstances that generate feelings of anxiety – what steps can we take as a section, or a team, to recognize and respond to these circumstances?\n\n\nHow can you add to the psychological safety of your peers in the section and lab teammates?",

In particular, if the underlying distribution that generates the data is not normal, than the assumptions of a t-test are not, technically satisfied and the test does not produce results that have nominal p-value coverage. This is both technically and theoretically true; and yet, researchers, data scientists, your instructors, and the entire world runs t-tests as “test of first recourse.”\nWhat is the alternative to conducting a t-test as the test of first recourse? It might be the Wilcox test. The Wilcox test makes a weaker assumption – of symmetry around the mean or median – which is weaker than the assumption of normality.\nAdditional points of argument, which you will investigate in this worksheet:\n\nIf the underlying data is normal, then the Wilcox test is nearly as well powered as the t-test.\nIf the underlying data is not normal, then the Wilcox test still maintains nominal p-value coverage, whereas the t-test might lose this guarantee.",

Here, we are first going to show that this is true, and then we’re going to reason about what this means, and why this feature is interesting (or at least useful) when we are estimating a regression.\nSuppose that the population model is the following:\n\\[\nX_{1} =\n\\begin{cases}\n  \\frac{1}{10}, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 10, \\\\\n  0, & otherwise\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{2} =\n\\begin{cases}\n  \\frac{1}{10}, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 10, \\\\\n  0, & otherwise\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\nX_{3} =\n\\begin{cases}\n  \\frac{1}{10}, & 0 \\leq x \\leq 10, \\\\\n  0, & otherwise\n\\end{cases}\n\\] And, furthermore suppose that \\(Y = g(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}\\), specifically, that:\n\\[\nY = -3 + (1\\cdot X_1) + (2\\cdot X_2) + (3\\cdot X_3)\n\\] Then, because we know the population model, we can produce a single sample from it using the following code:\n\nd &lt;- data.frame(\n  x1 = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 10), \n  x2 = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 10), \n  x3 = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 10)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(y = -3 + 1*x1 + 2*x2 + 3*x3 + rnorm(n = n(), mean = 0, sd = 1))\n\nhead(d)\n\n        x1       x2       x3        y\n1 6.218677 2.651004 5.519509 25.26302\n2 7.208680 5.704039 9.513955 41.61790\n3 4.437298 5.411798 3.212990 22.78072\n4 8.450337 7.524730 8.323597 45.43666\n5 2.313235 7.518738 4.704166 28.82640\n6 6.355665 4.821157 9.534551 41.48268\n\n\nNotice that when we made this data, we included a set of random noise at the end. The idea here is that there are other “things” in this universe that also affect \\(Y\\), but that we don’t have access to them. By assumption, what we have measured in this world, \\(X_1, X_2, X_3\\) are uncorrelated with these other features.\n\n8.6.1 Estimate an OLS Regression\nLet’s begin by producing an estimate of the OLS regression of Y on these X variables. Notice the way that we’re talking about this:\n\nWe are going to regress Y on \\(X_{1}\\), \\(X_{2}\\), and \\(X_{3}\\).\n\n\nmodel_main &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = d)\ncoef(model_main)\n\n(Intercept)          x1          x2          x3 \n -3.3488886   0.9996716   2.0585375   3.0065569 \n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Regression Anatomy and Fritch Waugh Lovell\nThe claim is that we can produce an estimate of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) using an auxiliary set of regression estimates, and then using the regression from that auxiliary regression.\n\nmodel_aux &lt;- lm(x1 ~ x2 + x3, data = d)\n\nIf we look into the structure of model_aux we can see that there are a ton of pieces in here.\n\nstr(model_aux)\n\nList of 12\n $ coefficients : Named num [1:3] 4.1225 0.0668 0.1081\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:3] \"(Intercept)\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n $ residuals    : Named num [1:100] 1.322 1.676 -0.394 2.925 -2.82 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:100] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ effects      : Named num [1:100] -50.46 -1.77 3.16 2.62 -3.06 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:100] \"(Intercept)\" \"x2\" \"x3\" \"\" ...\n $ rank         : int 3\n $ fitted.values: Named num [1:100] 4.9 5.53 4.83 5.53 5.13 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:100] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ assign       : int [1:3] 0 1 2\n $ qr           :List of 5\n  ..$ qr   : num [1:100, 1:3] -10 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 ...\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. ..$ : chr [1:100] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n  .. .. ..$ : chr [1:3] \"(Intercept)\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"assign\")= int [1:3] 0 1 2\n  ..$ qraux: num [1:3] 1.1 1.02 1.07\n  ..$ pivot: int [1:3] 1 2 3\n  ..$ tol  : num 1e-07\n  ..$ rank : int 3\n  ..- attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"qr\"\n $ df.residual  : int 97\n $ xlevels      : Named list()\n $ call         : language lm(formula = x1 ~ x2 + x3, data = d)\n $ terms        :Classes 'terms', 'formula'  language x1 ~ x2 + x3\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"variables\")= language list(x1, x2, x3)\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"factors\")= int [1:3, 1:2] 0 1 0 0 0 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:3] \"x1\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"term.labels\")= chr [1:2] \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"order\")= int [1:2] 1 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"intercept\")= int 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"response\")= int 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; \n  .. ..- attr(*, \"predvars\")= language list(x1, x2, x3)\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"dataClasses\")= Named chr [1:3] \"numeric\" \"numeric\" \"numeric\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:3] \"x1\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n $ model        :'data.frame':  100 obs. of  3 variables:\n  ..$ x1: num [1:100] 6.22 7.21 4.44 8.45 2.31 ...\n  ..$ x2: num [1:100] 2.65 5.7 5.41 7.52 7.52 ...\n  ..$ x3: num [1:100] 5.52 9.51 3.21 8.32 4.7 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"terms\")=Classes 'terms', 'formula'  language x1 ~ x2 + x3\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"variables\")= language list(x1, x2, x3)\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"factors\")= int [1:3, 1:2] 0 1 0 0 0 1\n  .. .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:3] \"x1\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"term.labels\")= chr [1:2] \"x2\" \"x3\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"order\")= int [1:2] 1 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"intercept\")= int 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"response\")= int 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; \n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"predvars\")= language list(x1, x2, x3)\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dataClasses\")= Named chr [1:3] \"numeric\" \"numeric\" \"numeric\"\n  .. .. .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:3] \"x1\" \"x2\" \"x3\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"lm\"\n\n\nTo evaluate our claim, we need to find the residuals from this regression.

In the second model, we can use this orthagonal information to estimate the effect of one variable.",

This will estimate the model:\n\n\\[\n  price = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} sqrft + \\beta_{2} lotsize + \\beta_{3} colonial? + e\n\\]\n\nBUT BEFORE YOU DO, make a prediction: What do you think is going to happen to the coefficient that relates square footage and price?\n\nWill the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?\nWill the uncertainty about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?\nConduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model as a whole does better when the coefficients on colonial and lotsize are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e. \\(\\beta_{2} = \\beta_{3} = 0\\).\n\n\n\nUse the function vcovHC from the sandwich package to estimate (a) the the heteroskedastic consistent (i.e. “robust”) variance covariance matrix; and (b) the robust standard errors for the intercept and slope of this regression. Recall, what is the relationship between the VCOV and SE in a regression?\n\n\nPerform a hypothesis test to check whether the population relationship between sqrft and price is zero. Use coeftest() with the robust standard errors computed above.\n\n\nUse the robust standard error and qt to compute a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient sqrft in the second model that you estimated. \\(price = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} sqrft + \\beta_{2} lotsize + \\beta_{3} colonial\\).\nBootstrap. The book very quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling with replacement and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have.\n\nBelow is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the sqrft variable when lotsize and colonial are included in the model.\n\nbootstrap_sqft &lt;- function(d = data, number_of_bootstraps = 1000) { \n  number_of_rows &lt;- nrow(d)\n\n    coef_sqft &lt;- rep(NA, number_of_bootstraps)\n\n    for(i in 1:number_of_bootstraps) { \n      bootstrap_data &lt;- d[sample(x=1:number_of_rows, size=number_of_rows, replace=TRUE), ]  \n      estimated_model &lt;- lm(price ~ sqrft, data = bootstrap_data)\n      coef_sqft[i]    &lt;- coef(estimated_model)['sqrft']\n    }\n  return(coef_sqft)\n}\n\n\nbootstrap_result &lt;- bootstrap_sqft(d = data, number_of_bootstraps = 10000)\n\nWith this, it is possible to plot the distribution of these regression coefficients:\n\nggplot() + \n  aes(x = bootstrap_result) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(\n    x = 'Estimated Coefficient', \n    y = 'Count', \n    title = 'Bootstrap coefficients for square footage'\n  )\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the standard deviation of the bootstrapped regression coefficients. How does this compare to the robust standard errors you computed above?\n\ncoeftest(model_one, vcov. = vcovHC(model_one))\n\n\nt test of coefficients:\n\n             Estimate Std.

You run 7 different t-tests, one for posts on Monday (versus all other days), or for Tuesday (versus all other days), etc. Only the test for Sunday is significant, with a p-value of .045, so you throw out the other tests.\nShould you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts? (How can you address this situation responsibly when you publish your results?)\nSuch Update As before, you have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You do a little EDA and notice that Sunday seems to have more “status updates” than all other days, so you recode your “day of the week” variable into a binary one: Sunday = 1, All other days = 0. You run a t-test and get a p-value of .045. Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?\nSunday Funday Suppose researcher A tests if Monday has an effect (versus all other days), Researcher B tests Tuesday (versus all other days), and so forth. Only Researcher G, who tests Sunday finds a significant effect with a p-value of .045. Only Researcher G gets to publish her work. If you read the paper, should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?\nSunday Repentence What if researcher G above is a sociologist that chooses to measure the effect of Sunday based on years of observing the way people behave on weekends? Researcher G is not interested in the other tests, because Sunday is the interesting day from her perspective, and she wouldn’t expect any of the other tests to be significant.\nDecreasing Effect Sizes Many observers have noted that as studies yielding statistically significant results are repeated, estimated effect sizes go down and often become insignificant. Why is this the case?",
