As we settle in to study for the semester, it is useful to have a point of view of where we’re trying to go, and what we are going to see along the way. Allow a justification by analogy: Suppose that you decide that you would like to be a chef – all of the time watching cooking shows has revealed to you that this is your life’s true calling – and so you enroll in a culinary program. One does not begin such a program by baking croissants and souffle. They begin the program with knife skills, breaking down ingredients and the basic techniques that build up to produce someone who is not a cook, but a chef – someone who can combine ingredients and techniques to produce novel ideas. At the same time, however, one has not gone to school just to become a cucumber slicer. The knife skills are instrumental to the eventual goal – of being a chef – but not the goal itself. At the beginning of the program, we’re teaching these core, fundamental skills. How to read and reason with mathematical objects, how to use conditional probability with the goal of producing a model, and eventually, eventually to create novel work as a data scientist. At the end of this course, students will be able to: 1.2.1 Understand the building blocks of probability theory that prepare learners for the study of statistical models Understand the mathematical objects of probability theory and be able to apply their properties. Understand how high-level concepts from calculus and linear algebra are related to common procedures in data science. Translate between problems that are defined in business or research terms into problems that can be solved with math. 1.2.2 Understand and apply statistical models in common situations Understand the theory of statistics to prepare students for inferrential statements. Understand model parameters and high level strategies to estimate them: means, least squares, and maximum likelihood. Choose an appropriate statistic, and conduct a hypothesis test in the Neyman-Pearson framework. Interpret the results of a statistical test, including statistical significance and practical significance. Recognize limitations of the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing framework and be a conscientious participant in the scientific process 1.2.3 Analyze a research question using a linear regression framework Explore and wrangle data with the intention of understanding the information and relationships that are (and are not) present Identify the goals of your analysis Build a model that achieves the goals of an analysis 1.2.4 Interpret the results of a model and communicate them in manner appropriate to the audience Identify their audience and report process and findings in a manner appropriate to that audience. Construct regression oriented reports that provide insight for stakeholders. Construct technical documents of process and code for collaboration and reproducability with peer data scientists. Read, understand, and assess the claims that are made in technical, regression oriented reports 1.2.5 Contribute proficient, basic work, using industry standard tools and coding practices to a modern data science team.

Instructors hold PhDs in statistics, astrophysics, biology, political science, computer science, and information. 1.3.2 What does a statistician look like? You! Identity shapes how people approach and understand their world. We would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course. We each have been fortunate to be able to study, but we want to acknowledge that the education system in the US has systematically benefited the hegemonic groups and marginalized others voices. Every one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are. We want to see a field of data scientists who embrace each others voices, and respects people for the identies that they hold. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never taken a stats class before, or if you’re reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome. It doesn’t matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless. The color of your skin doesn’t matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University’s Principles of Community.

"],["probability-theory.html", "1.6 Probability Theory", " 1.6 Probability Theory Probability Probability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually every other model you’ll ever use as a data scientist. told you this would be spacey In this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it. In introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes’ Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you’ll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform – squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull – variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful information from your data. As you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely next word or words that someone might type? Beyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner. First, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a much fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e. compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn’t clearly fit into a box, there’s no way to move forward. Statistics like this is not fun. In the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you’re able to learn why certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven’t seen before. The second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements nearly always developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language. "],["axiomatic-probability.html", "1.7 Axiomatic Probability", " 1.7 Axiomatic Probability The book makes a point of defining our axioms of probability, calling them them Definition 1.1 Kolmogorov Axioms Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space, \\(S\\) be an event space, and \\(P\\) be a probability measure. Then, \\((\\Omega, S, P)\\) is a probability space if it satisfies the following: Non-negativity: \\(\\forall A \\in S, P(A) \\geq 0\\), where \\(P(A)\\) is finite and real. Unitarity: \\(P(\\Omega)=1\\). Countable additivity: if \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots \\in S\\) are pairwise disjoint, then \\[ P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) = \\sum_{i}P(A_{i}) \\] There is a lot going on in this definition! First things first, these are the axioms of probability (read aloud in the booming voice of a god). This means that these are things that we begin from, sort of the foundational principles of the entire system of reasoning that we are going to use. In the style of argument that we’re going to make, these are things that are sort of off-limits to question. Instead, these serve as the grounding assumptions, and we see what happens as we flow forward from these statements. Second, and importantly, from these axioms there are a very large set of things that we can build. The first set of things that we will build are probability statements about atomic outcomes (Theorem 1.1.4 in the book), and collections of events. But, these statements, are not the only thing that we’re limited to. We can also build Frequentist Statistics, and Bayesian Statistics and Language Models. In many ways, these axioms are the fundamental particles that hold our system of probabilistic reasoning together. These are to probability what the fermions and and bosons are to physics.

Understand that the intuition developed by the use of set-theory probability maps into the more expressive space of random variables Apply the appropriate mathematical transformations to move between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions. From the axioms of probability, it is possible to build a whole, expressive modeling system (that need not be grounded at all in the minutia of the world). With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are closer to the truth than predictions made without this information. There is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function. The beauty is that by reasoning with such general objects we can produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function. The tragedy is that in the “real world”, the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. In examples that we compute, to provide a chance to reason about these objects, we will typically write down a specific function that a random variable represents, despite the limitation that we cannot directly observe this function in the wild.

Does this definition help you? Definition 2.1 (Random Variable) A random variable is a function \\(X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\) such that \\(\\forall r \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega\\}: X(\\omega) \\leq r\\} \\in S\\). Someone, please, read that without using a single “omega”, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean. The goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be absolutely clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student’s home language. What are the key things that random variables allow you to accomplish? Suppose that you were going to try to make a model that predicts the probability of winning “big money” on the machine. Big money might be that you get :cherries: :cherries: :cherries:. Can you do math with :cherries:? Why do we say that random variables are functions? Is there some useful property of these being functions rather than any other quantity? 2.3.2 Functions of Functions What about a function of a random variable, which is a function of a function. Definition 2.2 (Function of a Random Variable) Let \\(g : U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be some function, where \\(X(\\Omega) \\subset U \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\). Then, if \\(g \\circ X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a random variable, we say that \\(g\\) is a function of X and write \\(g(X)\\) to denote the random variable \\(g \\circ X\\). If a random variable is a function from the real world, or the sample space, or the outcome space to a real number, then what does it mean to define a function of a random variable? At what point does this function work? Does this function change the sample space that is possible to observe? Or, does this function change the real-number that each outcome points to? Example 2.1 (MNIST) Suppose that you are doing some image processing work. To keep things simple, that you are doing image classification in the style of the MNIST dataset. Can someone describe what this task is trying to accomplish? Has anyone done work like this? However, suppose that rather than having good clean indicators for whether a pixel is on or off, instead you have weak indicators – there’s a lot of grey. A lot of the cells are marked in the range \\(0.2 - 0.3\\). How might creating a function that re-maps this grey into more extreme values help your model? Is it possible to “blur” events that are in the outcome space? Does this “blurring” meet the requirements of a function of a random variable, as provided above?

What do the Kolmogorov Axioms mean must be true about any probability mass function (pmf)? Example 2.2 (Berkeley Drivers, No Survivors) You should try driving in Berkeley some time. It is a trip! Without being deliberately ageist, the city is full of ageing hippies driving Subaru and making what seem to be stochastic right-or-left turns to buy incense, pottery, or just sourdough bread. Suppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you’re hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearly with each block that you cross. Finally, campus provides you with the safety reports from last year, and reports that there were 120 student-Subaru incidents last year, out of 10,000 student-crosswalk crossings. What is the pmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident as you walk across these 10 blocks? What sample space, \\(\\Omega\\) is appropriate to represent this scenario? Suppose that you don’t leave your house – this is a remote program after all! What is your cumulative probability of being involved in a student-subaru incident? What is the cumulative probability cmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident? Suppose that you live three blocks from campus, but your classmate lives five blocks from campus. What is the difference in the cumulative probability? How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk closer to campus? That is, suppose that you start 10 blocks away from campus, and are walking to get closer. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way to campus increasing or decreasing as you get closer to campus? How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk further from campus? That is, suppose that you start on campus, and you’re walking to a bar after classes. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way away from campus increasing or decreasing as you get further from campus?

As a way of starting the conversation, consider the following cases: Suppose \\(X\\) is a random variable that describes the time a student spends on w203 homework 1. If you have only granular measurement – i.e. the number of nights spent working on the homework – is this discrete or continuous? If you have the number of hours, is it discrete or continuous? If you have the number of seconds? Or milliseconds? Is it possible that \\(P(X = a) = 0\\) for every point \\(a\\)? For example, that \\(P(X = 3600) = 0\\). Does one of these measures have more information in it than another? How are measurement choices that we make as designers of information capture systems – i.e. the machine processes, human processes, or other processes that we are going to work with as data scientists – reflected in both the amount of information that is gathered, the type of information that is gathered, and the types of random variables that are manifest as a result? "],["moving-between-pdf-and-cdf.html", "2.6 Moving Between PDF and CDF", " 2.6 Moving Between PDF and CDF The book defines pmf and cmf first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the cdf, which is the cumulative density function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it. More importantly for this course, in Definition 1.2.15 the book defines the relationship between cdf and pdf in the following way: Definition 2.4 (Probability Density Function (PDF)) For a continous random variable \\(X\\) with CDF \\(F\\), the probability density function of \\(X\\) is \\[ f(x) = \\left. \\frac{d F(u)}{du} \\right|_{u=x}, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}. \\] How does this definition, which relates pdf and cdf by a means of differentiation and integration, fit with the ideas that we just developed in the context of walking to and from campus?

Also, suppose that you know that the smallest value that is possible for this random variable to obtain is 0. What is the CDF of \\(X\\)? What is the maximum possible value that \\(x\\) can obtain? How did you develop this answer, using the Kolmogorov axioms of probability? What is the cumulative probability of an outcome up to 0.5? What is the probability of an outcome between 0.25 and 0.75?

However, there’s not really that much else that we can do; and, there is probably very little in our professional worlds that would look like a single random variable in isolation. We really start to get to something useful when we consider joint density functions. Joint density functions describe the probability that both of two random variables. That is, if we are working with random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then the joint density function provides a probability statement for \\(P(X \\cap Y)\\). In this course, we might typically write this joint density function as \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f(\\cdot)\\) where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the actual function that represents the joint probability. 2.7.1 Uniform Joint Density Suppose that we know that two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are jointly uniformly distributed within the the support \\(x \\in [0,4], y \\in [0,4]\\). We have a requirement, imposed by the Kolmogorov Axioms that all probabilities must be non-zero, and that the total probability across the whole support must be one. Can you use these facts to determine answers to the following: What kind of shape does this joint pdf have? What is the specific function that describes this shape? If you draw this shape on three axes, and \\(X\\), and \\(Y\\), and a \\(P(X,Y)\\), what does this plot look like? How do you get from the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \\(X\\)? How do you get form the joint density function, to a marginal denisty function for \\(Y\\)?

In your own words, what is the difference between the distribution and the sample you are taking? The Visualization Trick This is a pretty useful trick.

Return the sum of the previous draws. rz &lt;- function() { 2 # Replace with your code } Use the previous code to repeat this experiment 10,000 times and plot a histogram.

In this week’s async, we make a statement of performance that we can use to evaluate how good a job a predictor is doing, choosing Mean Squared Error. With the goal of minimizing MSE, then we then present, justify, and prove that the conditional expectation function (the CEF) is the globally best possible predictor. This is an incredible powerful result, and one that serves as the backstop for every other predictor that you will ever fit, whether that predictor is a “simple” regression, or that predictor is a machine learning algorithms (e.g. a random forest) or a deep learning algorithm. Read that again – even the most technologically advanced algorithms cannot possibly perform better than the conditional expectation function. Why does the CEF do so well? Because it can contain a vast amount of complex information and relationships; in fact, the complexity of the CEF is a product of the complexity of the underlying probability space. If that is the case, then why don’t we just use the CEF as our predictor every time? Well, this is one of the core problems of applied data science work: we are never given the function that describes the behavior of the random variable. And so, we’re left in a world where we are forced to produce predictions from simplifications of the CEF. A very strong simplification, but one that is useful for our puny human brains, is to restrict ourselves to predictors that make predictions from a linear combination of input variables. Why should we make such a strong restriction? After all, the conditional expectation function might be a fantastically complex combination of input features, why should we entertain functions that are only linear combinations? Essentially, this is because we’re limited in our ability to reason about anything more complex than a linear combination.

"],["hypothesis-testing.html", "Unit 6 Hypothesis Testing", " Unit 6 Hypothesis Testing Frequentist Hypothesis testing is a very well established framework in the applied practice, and scientific literature. Sometimes (often, currently) referred to as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, this framework essentially makes an absurd assumption and asks the data to overturn that absurt assumption. Like a petulant child, NHST essentially proclaims, “Oh yeah? Well, if you actually loved me then you would buy me an iPad!” Which is to say, it says, “Oh yeah? If this absurd thing isn’t true, prove it to me!” update! What is Frequentist testing doing? This testing framework works on samples of data, and applies estimators to produce estimates of population parameters that are fundamentally unknown and unknowable. Despite this unknown and unknowable population target, with some carefully written down estimators we can rely on the convergence characteristics of some estimators to produce useful, reliable results. We begin with the one-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test relies on the sample average as an estimator of a population expectation. In doing so, it relies on the effectiveness of the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem to guarantee that the estimator that converges in probability to the population expectation, while also converging in distribution to a Gaussian distribution. These two convergences permit a data scientist to make several inferences based on data: The probability of generating data that “looks like what is observed”, if the null-hypothesis were true. This is often referred to as the p-value of a test, and is the petulant statement identified above. An interval of values that, with some stated probability (e.g. 95%), contains the true population parameter. This framework begins a exceedingly important task that we must understand, and undertake when we are working as data scientists: Producing our best-estimate, communicating how we arrived at that estimate, what (if any) guarantees that estimate provides, and crucially all limitations of our estimate.

Looking Ahead We’ll build on the one-sample t-test, to introduce several other statistical tests. We’ll see how to choose a test from different alternatives, with an eye on meeting the required assumptions, and maximizing power.

It provides the opportunity to work together on a data pipeline with people from all over the organization, to deal with technical, statistical, and social questions that are always interesting. While we expect that everyone on a team will be a professional, there is so much range within the pursuit of data science that projects are nearly always collaborative exercises. Together as teams, we Define research ambitions and scope Imagine/envision the landscape of what is possible Support, discuss, review and integrate individual contributions Together as individuals we conduct the heads-down work that moves question answering forward.

You might think of this as “casting down” data from three dimensions, to only two. Sketch the following 2d scatter plots, taking care the label your axes. You need not represent all 100 points, but rather create the gestalt of what you see. 1. \\(Y = f(x_1)\\) (but not \\(x_2\\)) 2. \\(Y = f(x_2)\\) (but not \\(x_1\\)) 3. \\(x2 = f(x_1)\\) Once you have sketched the scatter plots, what line would you fit that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in the vertical direction. Define a residual, \\(\\epsilon\\), to be the vertical distance between the line you draw, and the corresponding point on the input data. What is the average of the residuals for each of the lines that you have fitted? How does this correspond to the moment conditions discussed in the async? What would happen if you translated this line vertically? Rotate the cube so that the points “fall into line”.

Will the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same? Will the uncertainty about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same? Conduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model as a whole does better when the coefficients on colonial and lotsize are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e. \\(\\beta_{2} = \\beta_{3} = 0\\).

Bootstrap. The book very quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling with replacement and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have. Below is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the sqrft variable when lotsize and colonial are included in the model. bootstrap_sqft &lt;- function(d = data, number_of_bootstraps = 1000) { number_of_rows &lt;- nrow(d) coef_sqft &lt;- rep(NA, number_of_bootstraps) for(i in 1:number_of_bootstraps) { bootstrap_data &lt;- d[sample(x=1:number_of_rows, size=number_of_rows, replace=TRUE), ] estimated_model &lt;- lm(price ~ sqrft + lotsize + colonial, data = bootstrap_data) coef_sqft[i] &lt;- coef(estimated_model)[&#39;sqrft&#39;] } return(coef_sqft) } bootstrap_result &lt;- bootstrap_sqft(number_of_bootstraps = 1000) With this, it is possible to plot the distribution of these regression coefficients: ggplot() + aes(x = bootstrap_result) + geom_histogram() + labs( x = &#39;Estimated Coefficient&#39;, y = &#39;Count&#39;, title = &#39;Bootstrap coefficients for square footage&#39; ) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

For a large sample, we only need two mild assumptions to work with OLS To know coefficients are consistent To have valid standard errors, hypothesis tests Today The Classical Linear Model (CLM) allows us to apply regression to smaller samples.

For a few very simple probability models, a closed-form solution exists and the MLE can be derived by hand. (This is also potentially the case for OLS regression.) But, instead lets use some machine learning to find the estimates that maximize the likelihood function. There are many optimizers (e.g. optimize, and optim). optimize is the simplest to use, but only works in one dimension. 14.7.1 Optimization Example: Optimum Price Suppose that a firm’s profit from selling a product is related to price, \\(p\\), and cost, \\(c\\), as follows: \\[ \\text{profit} = (p - p^2) - c + 100 \\] Explain how you would use calculus to find the maximizing price. Assume that cost is fixed. What is the firms revenue as p=0, cost = 2? What is it at p=10, cost = 2? Create a plot with the following characteristics: On the x-axis is a sequence (seq()) of prices from [0, 10]. On the y-axis is the revenue as a function of those prices. Hold cost constant at c=2. What does the best price seem to be? Solve this numerically in R, using the optimize() function. Take note: using the default arguments, will optimize try to find a maximum or a minimum?

Referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one level of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning. In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session. Remember A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts. Understand A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept is, or why the concept works in the way that it does. Apply A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem. Analyze A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be. Evaluate A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals. Create A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.
