As we settle in to study for the semester, it is useful to have a point of view of where we’re trying to go, and what we are going to see along the way. Allow a justification by analogy: Suppose that you decide that you would like to be a chef – all of the time watching cooking shows has revealed to you that this is your life’s true calling – and so you enroll in a culinary program. One does not begin such a program by baking croissants and souffle. They begin the program with knife skills, breaking down ingredients and the basic techniques that build up to produce someone who is not a cook, but a chef – someone who can combine ingredients and techniques to produce novel ideas. At the same time, however, one has not gone to school just to become a cucumber slicer. The knife skills are instrumental to the eventual goal – of being a chef – but not the goal itself. At the beginning of the program, we’re teaching these core, fundamental skills. How to read and reason with mathematical objects, how to use conditional probability with the goal of producing a model, and eventually, eventually to create novel work as a data scientist. At the end of this course, students will be able to: 1.2.1 Understand the building blocks of probability theory that prepare learners for the study of statistical models Understand the mathematical objects of probability theory and be able to apply their properties. Understand how high-level concepts from calculus and linear algebra are related to common procedures in data science. Translate between problems that are defined in business or research terms into problems that can be solved with math. 1.2.2 Understand and apply statistical models in common situations Understand the theory of statistics to prepare students for inferrential statements. Understand model parameters and high level strategies to estimate them: means, least squares, and maximum likelihood. Choose an appropriate statistic, and conduct a hypothesis test in the Neyman-Pearson framework. Interpret the results of a statistical test, including statistical significance and practical significance. Recognize limitations of the Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing framework and be a conscientious participant in the scientific process 1.2.3 Analyze a research question using a linear regression framework Explore and wrangle data with the intention of understanding the information and relationships that are (and are not) present Identify the goals of your analysis Build a model that achieves the goals of an analysis 1.2.4 Interpret the results of a model and communicate them in manner appropriate to the audience Identify their audience and report process and findings in a manner appropriate to that audience. Construct regression oriented reports that provide insight for stakeholders. Construct technical documents of process and code for collaboration and reproducability with peer data scientists. Read, understand, and assess the claims that are made in technical, regression oriented reports 1.2.5 Contribute proficient, basic work, using industry standard tools and coding practices to a modern data science team.

Instructors hold PhDs in statistics, astrophysics, biology, political science, computer science, and information. 1.3.2 What does a statistician look like? You! Identity shapes how people approach and understand their world. We would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course. We each have been fortunate to be able to study, but we want to acknowledge that the education system in the US has systematically benefited the hegemonic groups and marginalized others voices. Every one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are. We want to see a field of data scientists who embrace each others voices, and respects people for the identies that they hold. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never taken a stats class before, or if you’re reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome. It doesn’t matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless. The color of your skin doesn’t matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University’s Principles of Community.

"],["probability-theory.html", "1.6 Probability Theory", " 1.6 Probability Theory Probability Probability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually every other model you’ll ever use as a data scientist. told you this would be spacey In this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it. In introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes’ Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you’ll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform – squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull – variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful information from your data. As you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely next word or words that someone might type? Beyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner. First, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a much fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e. compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn’t clearly fit into a box, there’s no way to move forward. Statistics like this is not fun. In the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you’re able to learn why certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven’t seen before. The second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements nearly always developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language. "],["axiomatic-probability.html", "1.7 Axiomatic Probability", " 1.7 Axiomatic Probability The book makes a point of defining our axioms of probability, calling them them Definition 1.1 Kolmogorov Axioms Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a sample space, \\(S\\) be an event space, and \\(P\\) be a probability measure. Then, \\((\\Omega, S, P)\\) is a probability space if it satisfies the following: Non-negativity: \\(\\forall A \\in S, P(A) \\geq 0\\), where \\(P(A)\\) is finite and real. Unitarity: \\(P(\\Omega)=1\\). Countable additivity: if \\(A_1, A_2, A_3, \\dots \\in S\\) are pairwise disjoint, then \\[ P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3 \\cup \\dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) = \\sum_{i}P(A_{i}) \\] There is a lot going on in this definition! First things first, these are the axioms of probability (read aloud in the booming voice of a god). This means that these are things that we begin from, sort of the foundational principles of the entire system of reasoning that we are going to use. In the style of argument that we’re going to make, these are things that are sort of off-limits to question. Instead, these serve as the grounding assumptions, and we see what happens as we flow forward from these statements. Second, and importantly, from these axioms there are a very large set of things that we can build. The first set of things that we will build are probability statements about atomic outcomes (Theorem 1.1.4 in the book), and collections of events. But, these statements, are not the only thing that we’re limited to. We can also build Frequentist Statistics, and Bayesian Statistics and Language Models. In many ways, these axioms are the fundamental particles that hold our system of probabilistic reasoning together. These are to probability what the fermions and and bosons are to physics.

With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are closer to the truth than predictions made without this information. There is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function. The beauty is that by reasoning with such general objects – the definitions that we create, and the theorems that we derive in this section of the course – produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function. We will compute several examples of specific functions to provide a chance to reason about these objects and how they “work”. The tragedy is that in the “real world”, the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. Perhaps this is the creation myth for probability theory: in a perfect world, we can produce a perfect result. But, in the “fallen” world of data, we will only be able to produce approximations.

Does this definition help you? Definition 2.1 (Random Variable) A random variable is a function \\(X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R},\\) such that \\(\\forall r \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: X(\\omega) \\leq r\\} \\in S\\). Someone, please, read that without using a single “omega”, \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean. The goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be absolutely clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student’s home language. What are the key things that random variables allow you to accomplish? Suppose that you were going to try to make a model that predicts the probability of winning “big money” on a slot machine.

There are two key pieces that must exist for every random variable. What are these pieces? The first of these pieces is provided to us in Definition 1.2.1 Random Variable (on page 16). The second is provided to us in Definition 1.2.5 Probability Mass Function (on page 18). Suppose that a random variable is simple and discrete. For concreteness, you could think of this random variable as the answer to the question, “Is the grass wet outside?”. What is the sample space? What is a sensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values? What is a insensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values? (A student well-seasoned in Maths might use (and define for the rest of the class) the concept of a bijective function). If you simply had the values that the random variable function maps to are you guaranteed to be able to describe the entire sample space? Why or why not? How would you go about determining the probability mass function for this random variable? 2.5.1 Functions of Functions Why do we say that random variables are functions? Is there some useful property of these being functions rather than any other quantity? What else could they be if not a function? What about a function of a random variable, which is a function of a function. Definition 2.3 (Function of a Random Variable) Let \\(g : U \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) be some function, where \\(X(\\Omega) \\subset U \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\). Then, if \\(g \\circ X : \\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is a random variable, we say that \\(g\\) is a function of X and write \\(g(X)\\) to denote the random variable \\(g \\circ X\\). If a random variable is a function from the real world, or the sample space, or the outcome space to a real number, then what does it mean to define a function of a random variable? At what point does this function work? Does this function change the sample space that is possible to observe? Or, does this function change the real-number that each outcome points to? Example 2.1 (MNIST) Suppose that you are doing some image processing work. To keep things simple, that you are doing image classification in the style of the MNIST dataset. Can someone describe what this task is trying to accomplish? Has anyone done work like this? However, suppose that rather than having good clean indicators for whether a pixel is on or off, instead you have weak indicators – there’s a lot of grey. A lot of the cells are marked in the range \\(0.2 - 0.3\\). How might creating a function that re-maps this grey into more extreme values help your model? Is it possible to “blur” events that are in the outcome space? Does this “blurring” meet the requirements of a function of a random variable, as provided above? 2.5.2 Probability Density Functions and Cumulative Density Functions What is a probability mass function? What do the Kolmogorov Axioms mean must be true about any probability mass function (pmf)? Example 2.2 (Berkeley Drivers, No Survivors) You should try driving in Berkeley some time. It is a trip! Without being deliberately ageist, the city is full of ageing hippies driving Subaru Outbacks and making what seem to be stochastic right-or-left turns to buy incense, pottery, or just sourdough bread. Suppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you’re hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearly with each block that you cross. Finally, campus provides you with the safety reports from last year, and reports that there were 120 student-Subaru incidents last year, out of 10,000 student-crosswalk crossings. What is the pmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident as you walk across these 10 blocks? What sample space, \\(\\Omega\\) is appropriate to represent this scenario? Suppose that you don’t leave your house – this is a remote program after all! What is your cumulative probability of being involved in a student-subaru incident? What is the cumulative probability cmf for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident? Suppose that you live three blocks from campus, but your classmate lives five blocks from campus. What is the difference in the cumulative probability? How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk closer to campus? That is, suppose that you start 10 blocks away from campus, and are walking to get closer. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way to campus increasing or decreasing as you get closer to campus? How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk further from campus? That is, suppose that you start on campus, and you’re walking to a bar after classes. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way away from campus increasing or decreasing as you get further from campus? "],["discrete-continuous-random-variables.html", "2.6 Discrete &amp; Continuous Random Variables", " 2.6 Discrete &amp; Continuous Random Variables What, if anything is fundamentally different between discrete and continuous random variables? As a way of starting the conversation, consider the following cases: Suppose \\(X\\) is a random variable that describes the time a student spends on w203 homework 1. If you have only granular measurement – i.e. the number of nights spent working on the homework – is this discrete or continuous? If you have the number of hours, is it discrete or continuous? If you have the number of seconds? Or milliseconds? Is it possible that \\(P(X = a) = 0\\) for every point \\(a\\)? For example, that \\(P(X = 3600) = 0\\). Does one of these measures have more information in it than another? How are measurement choices that we make as designers of information capture systems – i.e. the machine processes, human processes, or other processes that we are going to work with as data scientists – reflected in both the amount of information that is gathered, the type of information that is gathered, and the types of random variables that are manifest as a result? "],["moving-between-pdf-and-cdf.html", "2.7 Moving Between PDF and CDF", " 2.7 Moving Between PDF and CDF The book defines pmf and cmf first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the cdf, which is the cumulative density function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it. More importantly for this course, in Definition 1.2.15 the book defines the relationship between cdf and pdf in the following way: Definition 2.4 (Probability Density Function (PDF)) For a continuous random variable \\(X\\) with CDF \\(F\\), the probability density function of \\(X\\) is \\[ f(x) = \\left. \\frac{d F(u)}{du} \\right|_{u=x}, \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}. \\] How does this definition, which relates pdf and cdf by a means of differentiation and integration, fit with the ideas that we just developed in the context of walking to and from campus? Example 2.3 (Working with a continuous pdf and cdf) Suppose that you learn than a particular random variable, \\(X\\) has the following function that describes its pdf, \\(f_{x}(x) = \\frac{1}{10}x\\). Also, suppose that you know that the smallest value that is possible for this random variable to obtain is 0. What is the CDF of \\(X\\)? What is the maximum possible value that \\(x\\) can obtain? How did you develop this answer, using the Kolmogorov axioms of probability? What is the cumulative probability of an outcome up to 0.5? What is the probability of an outcome between 0.25 and 0.75? Produce an answer to this in two ways: Using the \\(pdf\\) Using the \\(cdf\\) "],["joint-density.html", "2.8 Joint Density", " 2.8 Joint Density Working with a single random variable helps to develop our understanding of how to relate the different features of a pdf and a cdf through differentiation and integration. However, there’s not really that much else that we can do; and, there is probably very little in our professional worlds that would look like a single random variable in isolation. We really start to get to something useful when we consider joint density functions. Joint density functions describe the probability that both of two random variables. That is, if we are working with random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), then the joint density function provides a probability statement for \\(P(X \\cap Y)\\). In this course, we might typically write this joint density function as \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f(\\cdot)\\) where \\(f(\\cdot)\\) is the actual function that represents the joint probability. The \\(f(\\cdot)\\) means, essentially, “some function” where we just have not designated the specifics of the function; you might think of this as a generic function. 2.8.1 Example: Uniform Joint Density Suppose that we know that two variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are jointly uniformly distributed within the the support \\(x \\in [0,4], y \\in [0,4]\\). We have a requirement, imposed by the Kolmogorov Axioms that all probabilities must be non-zero, and that the total probability across the whole support must be one. Can you use these facts to determine answers to the following: What kind of shape does this joint pdf have? What is the specific function that describes this shape? If you draw this shape on three axes, and \\(X\\), and \\(Y\\), and a \\(P(X,Y)\\), what does this plot look like? How do you get from the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \\(X\\)? How do you get form the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \\(Y\\)? How do you get from these marginal density functions of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) back to the joint density? Is this always possible? 2.8.2 Examples: Thinking Through Many Plots An alumni of the MIDS program, and a former instructor of this course, Todd Young built this nifty tool that lets us consider several different joint probability functions. As a class, lets consider a few of these PDFs, beginning with this “triangle” distribution. knitr::include_app(&#39;http://www.statistics.wtf/PDF_Explorer/&#39;, height=&quot;1000px&quot;) 2.8.3 Triangle Math After considering the intuition for the triangle distribution, do the following: Write down the function that accords with the figure that you’re seeing above.2 What is a full statement of the PDF of this image? What is the marginal distribution of \\(X\\), \\(f_{X}(x)\\)? What is the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\), \\(f_{Y}(y)\\)? Using the definition of independence, are \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) independent of each other? What is the CDF of \\(X\\), \\(F_{X}(x)\\)? 2.8.4 Saddle Sores Suppose that you know that two random variables, \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are jointly distributed with the following pdf: \\[ f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases} a * x^{2} * y^{2} &amp; 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, 0 &lt; y &lt; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] This joint pdf is similar to the pdf that you can visualize above, under the distribution called “saddle”.

This is on purpose! We want to develop the theory that defines the best possible predictor if we knew everything (if we know formula of the function that maps from \\(\\omega \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\), and we know the probability of each \\(\\omega \\in \\Omega\\) then we know everything). Beginning in week 5 of the course, we will talk about “approximating” (which we will call estimating) this best possible predictor with a limited sample of data. However, at this point, to help build your working understanding, or intuition, for what is happening, we are going to work on a way to simulate draws from a population. In some places, people might refer to these as Monte Carlo methods – this is because the method was developed by von Neumann &amp; Ulam during World War II, and they needed a way to talk about it using a code name. They chose Monte Carlo after a famous casino in Monaco. 2.11.1 Example: The Uniform Distribution You: “Gosh. There sure are a lot of examples that use the uniform distribution. That must be a really important statistical distribution.” Instructor: “Nah. Not really. We’re just using the uniform a bunch so that we don’t get too lost in doing math while we’re working with these concepts.” We’ll start with a simple uniform distribution, but then we’ll make it a little more complex in a moment. We can use R to simulate draws from a probability distribution function by providing it with the name of the distribution that we’re considering, the support of that distribution, or other features of the distribution. In the case of the uniform, the entire distribution is can be described just from it support. So, suppose that you had a uniform distribution that had positive probability on the range \\([1.1, 4.3]\\). Why these? No particular reason. That is, suppose \\[ f_{X}(x) = \\begin{cases} a &amp; 1.1 \\leq x \\leq 4.3 \\\\ 0 &amp; otherwise \\end{cases} \\] What does this distribution “look like”? Because it is a uniform, you might have a sense that it will be a horizontal line. But, what is the height of that line? Aha! We could do the math to figure it out, or we could generate an approximation using a simulation. In the code below, we are going to create an object called samples_uniform that stores the results of the runif function call. samples_uniform &lt;- runif(n=1000, min=1.1, max=4.3) What is happening inside runif? When you’re writing you own code, you can pull up the documentation for this (and any) function using a question mark, i.e. ?, followed by the function name – ?runif. But, we can speed this up slightly by simply telling you that n is the number of samples to take from the population; min is the low-end of the support, and max is the high-end of the support. If we look into this object, we can see the results of the function call. Below, we will show the first \\(20\\) elements of the samples_uniform object. samples_uniform[1:20] ## [1] 4.215746 2.635914 4.213891 2.641486 2.365334 2.879419 3.718120 3.555751 3.763525 3.264678 4.125250 3.611000 3.209280 3.727918 ## [15] 2.249801 3.282331 3.187835 4.211611 2.957040 2.519272 (Notice that R is a \\(1\\) index language (python is a zero-index language).)

From what we can see here, there does not appear to be any discernible pattern. This leaves us with two options: either, we might reduce the resolution that we’re using to view this pattern, or we might take more samples and hold the resolution constant. Below, two different plots show these differing approaches, and are very explicit about the code that creates them. samples_uniform_moar &lt;- runif(n=1000000, min=1.1, max=4.3) plot_low_res &lt;- ggplot() + aes(x=samples_uniform) + geom_density(bw=0.1) + lims(y=c(0,0.4)) + labs(title = &#39;Low Res, Low Data&#39;) plot_high_res &lt;- ggplot() + aes(x=samples_uniform_moar) + geom_density(bw=0.01) + lims(y=c(0,0.4)) + labs(title = &#39;High Res, More Data&#39;) plot_low_res | plot_high_res 2.11.2 Example: The Normal Distribution Folks might have some prior beliefs about the Normal distribution. Don’t worry, we’ll cover this later in the course. But, this is the distribution that you have in mind when you’re thinking of a “bell curve”. We can use the same method to visualize a normal distribution as we did for a uniform distribution. In this case, we would issue the call rnorm, together with the population parameters that define the population. At this point in the course, we do not expect that you will know these (and, actually memorizing these facts are not a core focus of the course), but you can look them up if you like. Truthfully, statistics wikipedia is very good. Do do you notice anything about the runif and the rnorm calls that we have identified? Both seem to name the distribution: \\(unif \\approx uniform\\) and \\(norm \\approx normal\\), but prepened with a r? This is for “random draw”. Base R is loaded with a pile of basic statistics distributions, which you can look into using ?distributions. samples_normal &lt;- rnorm(n=100000, mean=18, sd=4) Like before, we could look at the first \\(20\\) of these samples. samples_normal[1:20] ## [1] 16.81166 20.38086 15.57776 15.64389 20.21407 18.01708 17.52014 17.83761 20.22760 17.08060 17.37409 23.36864 14.59691 14.47746 ## [15] 21.50123 23.35356 21.26067 24.65082 15.37435 16.24400 And, from here we could visualize this distribution. ggplot() + aes(x=samples_normal) + geom_density() + labs(title=&#39;Visualization of this Normal Distribution&#39;) 2.11.2.1 Combining This Ability Consider three random variables \\(A, B, C\\).

We can describe the distribution of a random variable using: A CDF for all random variables A PMF for discrete random variables A PDF for continuous random variables When we have multiple random variables, The joint PMF/PDF describes how they behave together The marginal PMF/PDF describes one variable in isolation The conditonal PMF/PDF describes one variable given the value of another 3.2.2 Today’s Lesson What might seem frustrating about this probability theory system of reasoning is that we are building a castle in the sky – a fiction. We’re supposing that there is some function that describes the probability that values are generated. In reality, there is no such generative function; it is extremely unlikely (though we’ll acknowledge that it is possible) that the physical reality we belive we exist within is just a complex simulation that has been programmed with functions by some unknown designer. Especially frustrating is that we’re supposing this function, and then we’re further saying, “If only we had this impossible function; and if only we also had the ability to take an impossible derivative of this impossible function, then we could…” 3.2.2.1 Single number summaries of a single random variable But, here’s the upshot! What we are doing today is laying the baseline for models that we will introduce next week. Here, we are going to suggest that there are radical simplifications that we can produce that hold specific guarantees, no matter how complex the function that we’re reasoning about. In particular, in one specific usage of the term best we will prove that the Expectation operation is the best one-number summary of any distribution. To do so, we will define a term, variance, which is the squared deviations from the expectation of a variable that describes how “spread out” is a variable. Then, we will define a concept that is the mean squared error that is the square of the distance between a model prediction and a random variable’s realization. The key realization is that when the model predicts the expectation, then the MSE is equal to the variance of the random variable, which is the smallest possible value it could realize. 3.2.2.2 Single number summaries of relationships between random variables Although the single number summaries are incredibly powerful, that’s not enough for today’s lesson! We’re also going to suggest that we can create a measure of linear dependence between two variables that we call the “covariance”, and a related, rescaled version of this relationship that is called the correlation. 3.2.3 Future Attractions A predictor is a function that provides a value for one variable, given values of some others.

In this week’s async, we make a statement of performance that we can use to evaluate how good a job a predictor is doing, choosing Mean Squared Error. With the goal of minimizing MSE, then we then present, justify, and prove that the conditional expectation function (the CEF) is the globally best possible predictor. This is an incredible powerful result, and one that serves as the backstop for every other predictor that you will ever fit, whether that predictor is a “simple” regression, or that predictor is a machine learning algorithms (e.g. a random forest) or a deep learning algorithm. Read that again – even the most technologically advanced algorithms cannot possibly perform better than the conditional expectation function. Why does the CEF do so well? Because it can contain a vast amount of complex information and relationships; in fact, the complexity of the CEF is a product of the complexity of the underlying probability space. If that is the case, then why don’t we just use the CEF as our predictor every time? Well, this is one of the core problems of applied data science work: we are never given the function that describes the behavior of the random variable. And so, we’re left in a world where we are forced to produce predictions from simplifications of the CEF. A very strong simplification, but one that is useful for our puny human brains, is to restrict ourselves to predictors that make predictions from a linear combination of input variables. Why should we make such a strong restriction? After all, the conditional expectation function might be a fantastically complex combination of input features, why should we entertain functions that are only linear combinations? Essentially, this is because we’re limited in our ability to reason about anything more complex than a linear combination.

To simulate draws from a Bernoulli variable, you can either: Use sample Or, use rbinom (the Bernoulli distribution is a special case of a binomial distribution.

To understand it, use the visualization trick from a few weeks ago. Use the replicate function to run the above experiment 1000 times, and plot a histogram of the results. If you replicate the experiment enough times, will the distribution ever look normal? Why or why not? Use sd() to check the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean for number_of_coins = 3. What sample size is needed to decrease the standard deviation by a factor of 10? Check that your answer is correct. Part 2 For this part, we’ll continue to study a fair coin. Try different values for the sample size n, and examine the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean. At what point does it look normal to you? Part 3 For this part, we’ll study a very unfair coin. p = 0.01. This is an example of a highly skewed random variable. That roughly means that one tail is a lot longer than the other. For this activity, you can simply use your eyes to gauge how skewed a distribution is. If you prefer, you can also use the skewness command in the univar package to measure skewness. You may hear a rule of thumb that a skewness above 1 or below -1 is a highly skewed distribution. Start with n=3 as before. What do you notice about the shape of the sampling distribution? Try different values for the sample size n, and examine the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean. At what point does it look normal to you? 5.7.1 Discussion Questions How does the skewness of the population distribution affect the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem? What lesson can you take for your practice of statistics? Name a variable you would be interested in measuring that has a substantially skewed distribution. One definition of a heavy tailed distribution is one with infinite variance. For example, you can use the rcauchy command in R to take draws from a Cauchy distribution, which has heavy tails. Do you think a “heavy tails” distribution will follow the CLT? What leads you to this intuition? "],["hypothesis-testing.html", "Unit 6 Hypothesis Testing", " Unit 6 Hypothesis Testing Frequentist Hypothesis testing is a very well established framework in the applied practice, and scientific literature. Sometimes (often, currently) referred to as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, this framework essentially makes an absurd assumption and asks the data to overturn that absurd assumption. Like a petulant child, NHST essentially proclaims, “Oh yeah? Well, if you actually loved me then you would buy me an iPad!” Which is to say, it says, “Oh yeah? If this absurd thing isn’t true, prove it to me!” update! What is Frequentist testing doing? This testing framework works on samples of data, and applies estimators to produce estimates of population parameters that are fundamentally unknown and unknowable. Despite this unknown and unknowable population target, with some carefully written down estimators we can rely on the convergence characteristics of some estimators to produce useful, reliable results. We begin with the one-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test relies on the sample average as an estimator of a population expectation. In doing so, it relies on the effectiveness of the Weak Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem to guarantee that the estimator that converges in probability to the population expectation, while also converging in distribution to a Gaussian distribution. These two convergences permit a data scientist to make several inferences based on data: The probability of generating data that “looks like what is observed”, if the null-hypothesis were true. This is often referred to as the p-value of a test, and is the petulant statement identified above. An interval of values that, with some stated probability (e.g. 95%), contains the true population parameter. This framework begins a exceedingly important task that we must understand, and undertake when we are working as data scientists: Producing our best-estimate, communicating how we arrived at that estimate, what (if any) guarantees that estimate provides, and crucially all limitations of our estimate.

From this population, you might consider taking a sample of 100 observations, and representing this data in the following 3d scatter plot. In this plot, there are three dimensions, an \\(x_1, x_2\\), and \\(y\\) dimensions. knitr::include_app(url =&quot;http://www.statistics.wtf/minibeta_l01/&quot;) Rotate the cube and explore the data, looking at each face of the cube, including from the top down. One of the lessons that we learned during the random variables section of the course is that every random variable that has been measured can also be marginalized off. You might think of this as “casting down” data from three dimensions, to only two. Sketch the following 2d scatter plots, taking care the label your axes. You need not represent all 100 points, but rather create the gestalt of what you see. 1. \\(Y = f(x_1)\\) (but not \\(x_2\\)) 2. \\(Y = f(x_2)\\) (but not \\(x_1\\)) 3. \\(x2 = f(x_1)\\) Once you have sketched the scatter plots, what line would you fit that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in the vertical direction. Define a residual, \\(\\epsilon\\), to be the vertical distance between the line you draw, and the corresponding point on the input data. What is the average of the residuals for each of the lines that you have fitted? How does this correspond to the moment conditions discussed in the async? What would happen if you translated this line vertically? Rotate the cube so that the points “fall into line”. When you see this line, how does it help you describe the function that governs this data?

OLS provides a point estimate of the BLP Today Robust Standard Error: quantify the uncertainty of OLS coefficients Hypothesis testing with OLS coefficients Bootstrapping Looking Ahead Regression is a foundational tool that can be applied to different contexts The process of building a regression model looks different, depending on whether the goal is prediction, description, or explanation.

Our goal is description: what is the relationship between education and wages? We will proceed in two steps: First, we will discuss what the appropriate specifications are. Then we will estimate the different models to answer this question. We will use wage1 dataset in the wooldridge package in the following sections. #?wage1 #names(wage1) 10.5.1 Transformations 10.5.1.1 Applying and Interpreting Logarithms Which of the following specifications best capture the relationship between education and hourly wage?

Can we use \\(R^2\\) or Adjusted \\(R^2\\) to choose between level-level or log-level specifications?

Do a quick EDA and select the specification that better suits our description goal. \\(wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 educ + \\beta_2 exper + \\beta_3 tenure + u\\) \\(\\begin{aligned} wage &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 educ + \\beta_2 exper + \\beta_3 exper^2 + \\\\ &amp; \\beta_4 tenure + \\beta_5 tenure^2 + u \\end{aligned}\\) How do you interpret the \\(\\beta\\) coefficients? 10.5.1.3 Applying and Interpreting Indicator variables and interaction terms In the following models, first, explain why the indicator variables or interaction terms have been included. Then identify the reference group (if any) and interpret all coefficients. \\(wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 educ + \\beta_2 I(educ \\geq 12) + u\\) \\(wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 educ + \\beta_2 female + u\\) \\(wage = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 educ + \\beta_2 female + \\beta_3 educ*female + u\\) \\(\\begin{aligned} wage &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 female + \\beta_2 I(educ = 2) + \\beta_3 I(educ = 3)\\\\ &amp;...+ \\beta_{20} I(educ = 20) + u\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\) 10.5.2 Estimation Estimating Returns to Education Answer the following questions using an appropriate hypothesis test. Is a year of education associated with changes to hourly wage? (Include experience and tenure without polynomial terms). Is the association between wage and experience / wage and tenure non-linear? Is there evidence for gender wage discrimination in the U.S.? Is there any evidence for a graduation effect on wage?

The BLP is a useful way to summarize relationships in a model, and OLS regression is a way to estimate the BLP. OLS regression is a foundational tool that can be applied to questions of description Today Questions of explanation require a substantially different modeling process. To answer causal questions, we must work within a causal theory OLS regression is sometimes appropriate for measuring a causal effect, But, only when the model estimated matches the causal theory. So, we must watch out for omitted variable bias, reverse causality, and outcome variables on the right hand side.

Notice that you’ll need each of these pieces in the code that you’re about to write. sim_conf_int &lt;- function(n, alpha) { # Fill in your code to: # 1. simulate n draws from a standard normal dist. # 2. compute a confidence interval with confidence level alpha sample_draws &lt;- &#39;fill this in&#39; sample_mean &lt;- &#39;fill this in&#39; sample_sd &lt;- &#39;fill this in&#39; critical_t &lt;- &#39;fill this in&#39; ci_95 &lt;- &#39;fill this in&#39; return(ci_95) } sim_conf_int(n = 100, alpha = 0.25) ## [1] &quot;fill this in&quot; When your function is complete, you can use the following code to run your function 100 times and plot the results. many_confidence_intervals &lt;- function(num_simulations, n, alpha) { ## args: ## - num_simulations: the number of simulated confidence intervals ## - n: the number of observations in each simulation that will pass ## into your `sim_conf_int` function ## - alpha: the confidence interval that you will pass into ## your `sim_conf_int` function results &lt;- NULL for(i in 1:num_simulations) { interval = sim_conf_int(n, alpha) results = rbind(results, c(interval[1], interval[2], interval[1]&lt;0 &amp; interval[2]&gt;0)) } resultsdf = data.frame(results) names(resultsdf) = c(&quot;low&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, &quot;captured&quot;) return(resultsdf) } n = 20 confidence_intervals = many_confidence_intervals(100, n, .05) plot_many_confidence_intervals &lt;- function(c) { plot(NULL, type = &quot;n&quot;, xlim = c(1,100), xlab = &#39;Trial&#39;, ylim = c(min(c$low), max(c$high)), ylab=expression(mu),pch=19) abline(h = 0, col = &#39;gray&#39;) abline(h = qt(0.975, n-1)/sqrt(n), lty = 2, col = &#39;gray&#39;) abline(h = qt(0.025, n-1)/sqrt(n), lty = 2, col = &#39;gray&#39;) points(c$high, col = 2+c$captured, pch = 20) points(c$low, col = 2+c$captured, pch = 20) for(i in 1:nrow(c)) { lines(c(i,i), c(c$low[i],c$high[i]), col = 2+c$captured[i], pch = 19) } title(expression(paste(&quot;Simulation of t-Confidence Intervals for &quot;, mu, &quot; with Sample Size 20&quot;))) legend(0,-.65, legend = c(expression(paste(mu,&quot; Captured&quot;)), expression(paste(mu,&quot; Not Captured&quot;))), fill = c(3,2)) } # plot_many_confidence_intervals(confidence_intervals) How many of the simulated confidence intervals contain the true mean, zero? Suppose you run a single study. Based on what you’ve just written above, why is it incorrect to say that, “There is a 95% probability that the true mean is inside this (single) confidence interval”?

You have data from the last 10 times you tried. Question: What is the probability (\\(p\\)) that the printer jams on the next print job? bbc, office space Part II The data resembles draws from a Bernoulli distribution. However, even if we want to model this as a Bernoulli distribution, we do not know the value of the parameter, \\(p\\). 1- Define your random variable. 2- Write down the likelihood function 3- If it will make the math easier, log the likelihood function. 4- Path 1: Maximize the likelihood using calculus 5- Path 2: Maximize using numeric methods. "],["appendix.html", "Appendix ", " Appendix "],["blooms-taxonomy.html", "Bloom’s Taxonomy", " Bloom’s Taxonomy An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as Bloom’s Taxonomy, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one level of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning. In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session. Remember A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts. Understand A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept is, or why the concept works in the way that it does. Apply A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem. Analyze A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be. Evaluate A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals. Create A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.

Instead, this is just a learning task that lets the class assess their understanding of the definitions of random variables.↩︎ Note, when we say “shaped” here, we’re referring to the deeper concept of a statistical functional. A statistical functional is a function of a function that maps to a real number. So, if \\(T\\) is the functional that we’re thinking of, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a family of functions that it might operate on, and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers, a statistical functional is just \\(T: \\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\). The Expectation statistical functional, \\(E[X]\\) always has the form \\(\\int x f_{X}(x)dx\\).)↩︎ Take a moment to strategize just a little bit before you get going on this one. There is a way to compute this value that is easier than another way to compute this value.↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
