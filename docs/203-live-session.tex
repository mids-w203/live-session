Probability is a system of reasoning about the world in the face of incomplete information. In this course, we're going to develop an understanding of the implications of core parts of this theory, how this theory was developed, and how these implications relate to every other part of the practice of data science.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-learning-objectives}{%
\section{Course Learning Objectives}\label{course-learning-objectives}}

At this point in the course, there is so much that is before us! As we settle in to study for the semester, it is useful to have a point of view of where we're trying to go, and what we are going to see along the way.

Allow a justification by analogy:

\begin{quote}
Suppose that you decide that you would like to be a chef -- all of the time watching cooking shows has revealed to you that this is your life's true calling -- and so you enroll in a culinary program.

One does not begin such a program by baking croissants and souffle. They begin the program with knife skills, breaking down ingredients and the basic techniques that build up to produce someone who is not a \emph{cook}, but a \emph{chef} -- someone who can combine ingredients and techniques to produce novel ideas.

At the same time, however, one has not gone to school just to become a cucumber slicer. The knife skills are instrumental to the eventual goal -- of being a chef -- but not the goal itself.
\end{quote}

At the beginning of the program, we're teaching these core, fundamental skills. How to read and reason with mathematical objects, how to use conditional probability with the goal of producing a model, and eventually, \textbf{eventually} to create novel work as a data scientist.

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

\subsection{Instructor Introductions}\label{instructor-introductions}}

The instructors for the course come to the program, and to statistics from different backgrounds. Instructors hold PhDs in statistics, astrophysics, biology, political science, computer science, and information.

\hypertarget{what-does-a-statistician-look-like-you}{%
\subsection{What does a statistician look like? You!}\label{what-does-a-statistician-look-like-you}}

Identity shapes how people approach and understand their world.

We would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course. We each have been fortunate to be able to study, but we want to acknowledge that the education system in the US has systematically benefited the hegemonic groups and marginalized others voices.

Every one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are. We want to see a field of data scientists who embrace each others voices, and respects people for the identies that they hold.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It doesn't matter if you've never taken a stats class before, or if you're reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome.
\item
  It doesn't matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless.
\item
  The color of your skin doesn't matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University's \href{https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community}{Principles of Community}.

\textbf{Breakout One.} A \emph{name story} is the unique, and individual story that describes how you came to have the name that you do. While there may be many people are called the same thing, each of their name stories is unique.

Please share: \emph{What is your name story?}

Please share: \emph{What is your data science story? How did you wind up here, in this room today?}

\hypertarget{probability-theory}{%
\section{Probability Theory}\label{probability-theory}}

\textbf{Probability}

Probability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually \emph{every} other model you'll ever use as a data scientist.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/picard.jpg}
\caption{told you this would be spacey}
\end{figure}

In this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it.

In introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes' Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you'll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform -- squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull -- variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful \emph{information} from your data.

As you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely \emph{next} word or words that someone might type?

Beyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner.

First, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a \emph{much} fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e.~compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn't clearly fit into a box, there's no way to move forward.

\begin{quote}
Statistics like this is not fun.
\end{quote}

In the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you're able to learn \emph{why} certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven't seen before.

The second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements \emph{nearly always} developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language.

\hypertarget{axiomatic-probability}{%
\section{Axiomatic Probability}\label{axiomatic-probability}}

The book makes a point of defining our axioms of probability, calling them them

\begin{definition}
\emph{Kolmogorov Axioms}

Let \(\Omega\) be a sample space, \(S\) be an event space, and \(P\) be a probability measure. Then, \((\Omega, S, P)\) is a \emph{probability space} if it satisfies the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Non-negativity: \(\forall A \in S, P(A) \geq 0\), where \(P(A)\) is finite and real.
\item
  Unitarity: \(P(\Omega)=1\).
\item
  Countable additivity: if \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots \in S\) are pairwise disjoint, then
\end{itemize}

\[
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) = \sum_{i}P(A_{i})
\]
\end{definition}

There is a lot going on in this definition!

First things first, these are the \textbf{axioms of probability} (read aloud in the booming voice of a god).

This means that these are things that we begin from, sort of the foundational principles of the entire system of reasoning that we are going to use. In the style of argument that we're going to make, these are things that are sort of off-limits to question. Instead, these serve as the grounding assumptions, and we see what happens as we flow forward from these statements.

Second, and importantly, from these axioms there are a \emph{very large} set of things that we can build. The first set of things that we will build are probability statements about atomic outcomes (Theorem 1.1.4 in the book), and collections of events. But, these statements, are not the only thing that we're limited to. We can also build \emph{Frequentist Statistics}, and \emph{Bayesian Statistics} and \emph{Language Models}.

In many ways, these axioms are the fundamental particles that hold our system of probabilistic reasoning together. These are to probability what the \emph{fermions} and and \emph{bosons} are to physics.

\hypertarget{definition-vs.-theorem}{%
\section{Definition vs.~Theorem}\label{definition-vs.-theorem}}

What is the difference between a definition and a theorem? On pages 10 and 11 of the textbook, there is a rapid fire collection of pink boxes. We reproduce them here (notice that they may have different index numbers than the book -- this live session book autoindexes and we're not including every theorem and definition in this live session discussion guide).

\begin{definition}
\emph{Conditional Probability} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(B) > 0\), the \emph{conditional probablity} of \(A\) given \(B\) is \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(B) > 0\), \[P(A|B)P(B) = P(A \cap B)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\emph{Baye's Rule} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(A) > 0\) and \(P(B) > 0\), \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What would happen to the statement of the \emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability} if we did not have the definition of \emph{Conditional Probability}?
\item
  How does one get from the definition, to the law?
\item
  Can one get to \emph{Baye's Rule} wihtout using the \emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability}?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{working-with-a-sample-space}{%
\section{Working with a Sample Space}\label{working-with-a-sample-space}}

As a way to begin lets define terms that we will use for the next activities.

\textbf{Group Discussion Question}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the definition of a sample space?
\item
  What is the definition of an event?
\item
  How are sample spaces, and event spaces related?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{working-with-a-sample-space-part-i}{%
\subsection{Working with a Sample Space, Part I}\label{working-with-a-sample-space-part-i}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{You roll two six-sided dice}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How would you define an appropriate sample space, \(\Omega\)?
  \item
    How many elements exist in \(\Omega\)?
  \item
    What is an appropriate event space, and how many elements does it have?
  \item
    Give an example of an event.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5cm}

\hypertarget{working-with-a-sample-space-part-ii}{%
\subsection{Working with a Sample Space, Part II}\label{working-with-a-sample-space-part-ii}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{For a random sample of 1,000 Berkeley students}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How would you define an appropriate sample space, \(\Omega\)?
  \item
    How big is \(\Omega\)? How many elements does it contain?
  \item
    What is an example of an event for this scenario?
  \item
    Can a single person be represented in the space twice? Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5cm}

\hypertarget{independence}{%
\section{Independence}\label{independence}}

The book provides a (characteristically) terse statement of what it means for two events to be independent of one another.

\begin{definition}
\emph{Independence of Events} Events \(A, B \in S\) are \emph{independent} if \[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)\].
\end{definition}

In your own words:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What does it mean for two events to be independent of one another?
\item
  How do you \textbf{know} if two events are independent of one another?
\item
  How do you \textbf{test} if two events are independent of one another?
\end{itemize}

Try using this idea of independent in two places:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose that you are creating a model to predict an outcome. Further, suppose that two events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent of one another. \emph{Can you use \(B\) to predict \(A\)}?
\item
  If two events, \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then what happens if you work through a statement of conditional probability, \(P(A|B)\)?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Student Tasks to Complete}\label{student-tasks-to-complete}}

Before next live session, please complete the homework that builds on this unit. There are two parts, an \emph{applied} and a \emph{proof} part. You can submit these homework as many times as you like before the due date (you will not receive feedback), and you can access this homework through bCourses.

The \emph{applied} homework will be marked either \texttt{Correct} or \texttt{Incorrect} without partial credit applied. These are meant to be problems that you solve, and that have a single straightforward solution concept. The \emph{proof} homework will be marked for partial credit (out of three points) that evaluates your argument for your solution concept.

\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives-1}}

At the end of this week's course of study (which includes the async, sync, and homework) students should be able to

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} that random variable are neither random, or variables, but instead that they are a foundational object that we can use to reason about a world.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} that the intuition developed by the use of set-theory probability maps into the more expressive space of random variables
\item
  \textbf{Apply} the appropriate mathematical transformations to move between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.
\end{enumerate}

This week's materials are theoretical tooling to build toward one of the first notable results of the course, \textbf{conditional probability}. This is the idea that, if we know that one event has occurred, we can make a conditional statement about the probability distribution for another, dependent distribution.

\hypertarget{introduction-to-the-materirals}{%
\section{Introduction to the Materirals}\label{introduction-to-the-materirals}}

From the axioms of probability, it is possible to build a whole, expressive modeling system (that need not be grounded \textbf{at all} in the minutia of the world). With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are \emph{closer to the truth} than predictions made without this information.

There is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function.

The \textbf{beauty} is that by reasoning with such general objects -- the definitions that we create, and the theorems that we derive in this section of the course -- produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function. We will compute several examples of \emph{specific} functions to provide a chance to reason about these objects and how they ``work''.

The \textbf{tragedy} is that in the ``real world'', the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. Perhaps this is the creation myth for probability theory: in a perfect world, we can produce a perfect result. But, in the ``fallen'' world of data, we will only be able to produce approximations.

\subsection{Random Varaible}\label{random-varaible}}

What is a random variable? Does this definition help you?

\begin{definition}[Random Variable]
A random variable is a function \(X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) such that \(\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \leq r\} \in S\).
\end{definition}

Someone, please, read that without using a single ``omega'', \(\mathbb{R}\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean.

The goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be \emph{absolutely} clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student's home language.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the key things that random variables allow you to accomplish?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Suppose that you were going to try to make a model that predicts the probability of winning ``big money'' on a slot machine. Big money might be that you get :cherries: :cherries: :cherries:. Can you do \emph{math} with :cherries:?
  \item
    Suppose that you wanted to build a chatbort that uses a language model so that you don't have to do your homework anymore. How would you go about it?
  \item
    Suppose you want to direct class support to students in 203, but their grades are scored \texttt{{[}A,\ A-,\ ...,\ {]}} and features include prior statistics classes grades, also scored \texttt{A,\ A-,\ ...{]}}

\hypertarget{pieces-of-a-random-variable}{%
\section{Pieces of a Random Variable}\label{pieces-of-a-random-variable}}

\begin{definition}[Random Variable, Suite]
A random variable is a function \(X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) such that \(\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \{\omega \in \Omega\}: X(\omega) \leq r\} \in S\).
\end{definition}

There are two key pieces that must exist for every random variable. What are these pieces? The first of these pieces is provided to us in \textbf{Definition 1.2.1} \emph{Random Variable} (on page 16). The second is provided to us in \textbf{Definition 1.2.5} \emph{Probability Mass Function} (on page 18).

\begin{enumerate}

Suppose that a random variable is simple and discrete. For concreteness, you could think of this random variable as the answer to the question, ``Is the grass wet outside?''.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  What is the sample space?
\item
  What is a sensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values?
\item
  What is a insensible function that you might use to map from the sample space to real values? (A student well-seasoned in Maths might use (and define for the rest of the class) the concept of a \emph{bijective function}).
\item
  If you simply had the values that the random variable function maps to are you guaranteed to be able to describe the entire sample space? Why or why not?

  How would you go about determining the probability mass function for this random variable?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{functions-of-functions}{%
\subsection{Functions of Functions}\label{functions-of-functions}}

Why do we say that random variables are functions? Is there some useful property of these being functions rather than any other quantity? What else \emph{could} they be if not a function?

What about a function of a random variable, which is a function of a function.

\begin{definition}[Function of a Random Variable]
Let \(g : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be some function, where \(X(\Omega) \subset U \subset \mathbb{R}\). Then, if \(g \circ X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is a random variable, we say that \(g\) is a \emph{function} of X and write \(g(X)\) to denote the random variable \(g \circ X\).
\end{definition}

If a random variable is a function from the real world, or the sample space, or the outcome space to a real number, then what does it mean to define a function of a random variable?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At what point does this function work? Does this function change the sample space that is possible to observe? Or, does this function change the real-number that each outcome points to?
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[MNIST]

Suppose that you are doing some image processing work. To keep things simple, that you are doing image classification in the style of the MNIST dataset.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can someone describe what this task is trying to accomplish?
\item

\tightlist
\item
  How might creating a function that re-maps this grey into more extreme values help your model?

\begin{example}[Berkeley Drivers, No Survivors]

You should try driving in Berkeley some time. It is a \textbf{trip}! Without being deliberately ageist, the city is full of ageing hippies driving Subaru Outbacks and making what seem to be stochastic right-or-left turns to buy incense, pottery, or just sourdough bread.

Suppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you're hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearly with each block that you cross.

Finally, campus provides you with the safety reports from last year, and reports that there were 120 student-Subaru incidents last year, out of 10,000 student-crosswalk crossings.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the \emph{pmf} for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident as you walk across these 10 blocks? What sample space, \(\Omega\) is appropriate to represent this scenario?
\item
  Suppose that you don't leave your house -- this is a remote program after all! What is your cumulative probability of being involved in a student-subaru incident?\\
\item
  What is the cumulative probability \emph{cmf} for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident?
\item
  Suppose that you live three blocks from campus, but your classmate lives five blocks from campus. What is the difference in the cumulative probability?
\item
  How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk closer to campus? That is, suppose that you start 10 blocks away from campus, and are walking to get closer. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way to campus increasing or decreasing as you get closer to campus?
\item
  How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk \textbf{further} from campus? That is, suppose that you start on campus, and you're walking to a bar after classes. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way away from campus increasing or decreasing as you get further from campus?

\hypertarget{discrete-continuous-random-variables}{%

What, if anything is fundamentally different between discrete and continuous random variables? As a way of starting the conversation, consider the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose \(X\) is a random variable that describes the time a student spends on w203 homework 1.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you have only granular measurement -- i.e.~the number of nights spent working on the homework -- is this discrete or continuous?
  \item
    If you have the number of hours, is it discrete or continuous?
  \item
    If you have the number of seconds? Or milliseconds?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Is it possible that \(P(X = a) = 0\) for every point \(a\)? For example, that \(P(X = 3600) = 0\).
\item
  Does one of these measures have more \emph{information} in it than another?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How are measurement choices that we make as designers of information capture systems -- i.e.~the machine processes, human processes, or other processes that we are going to work with as data scientists -- reflected in both the amount of information that is gathered, the type of information that is gathered, and the types of random variables that are manifest as a result?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}{%
\section{Moving Between PDF and CDF}\label{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}}

The book defines \emph{pmf} and \emph{cmf} first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the \emph{cdf}, which is the cumulative density function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it.

More importantly for this course, in \textbf{Definition 1.2.15} the book defines the relationship between \emph{cdf} and \emph{pdf} in the following way:

\begin{definition}[Probability Density Function (PDF)]
For a continuous random variable \(X\) with CDF \(F\), the \emph{probability density function} of \(X\) is

\[
  f(x) = \left. \frac{d F(u)}{du} \right|_{u=x}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does this definition, which relates \emph{pdf} and \emph{cdf} by a means of differentiation and integration, fit with the ideas that we just developed in the context of walking to and from campus?
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Working with a continuous pdf and cdf]

Suppose that you learn than a particular random variable, \(X\) has the following function that describes its \emph{pdf}, \(f_{x}(x) = \frac{1}{10}x\). Also, suppose that you know that the smallest value that is possible for this random variable to obtain is 0.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the CDF of \(X\)?
\item
  What is the maximum possible value that \(x\) can obtain? How did you develop this answer, using the Kolmogorov axioms of probability?
\item
  What is the cumulative probability of an outcome up to 0.5?
\item
  What is the probability of an outcome between 0.25 and 0.75? Produce an answer to this in two ways:
\item
  Using the \(pdf\)
\item
  Using the \(cdf\)
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{joint-density}{%
\section{Joint Density}\label{joint-density}}

Working with a single random variable helps to develop our understanding of how to relate the different features of a \emph{pdf} and a \emph{cdf} through differentiation and integration. However, there's not really \emph{that} much else that we can do; and, there is probably very little in our professional worlds that would look like a single random variable in isolation.

We really start to get to something useful when we consider joint density functions. Joint density functions describe the probability that \emph{both} of two random variables. That is, if we are working with random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), then the joint density function provides a probability statement for \(P(X \cap Y)\).

In this course, we might typically write this joint density function as \(f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f(\cdot)\) where \(f(\cdot)\) is the actual function that represents the joint probability. The \(f(\cdot)\) means, essentially, ``some function'' where we just have not designated the specifics of the function; you might think of this as a generic function.

\hypertarget{example-uniform-joint-density}{%
\subsection{Example: Uniform Joint Density}\label{example-uniform-joint-density}}

Suppose that we know that two variables, \(X\) and \(Y\) are jointly uniformly distributed within the the \emph{support} \(x \in [0,4], y \in [0,4]\). We have a requirement, imposed by the \emph{Kolmogorov Axioms} that all probabilities must be non-zero, and that the total probability across the whole support must be one.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can you use these facts to determine answers to the following:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What kind of shape does this joint \emph{pdf} have?
  \item
    What is the specific function that describes this shape?
  \item
    If you draw this shape on three axes, and \(X\), and \(Y\), and a \(P(X,Y)\), what does this plot look like?
  \item
    How do you get from the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \(X\)?
  \item
    How do you get form the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \(Y\)?
  \item
    How do you get from these marginal density functions of \(X\) and \(Y\) back to the joint density? Is this always possible?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{examples-thinking-through-many-plots}{%
\subsection{Examples: Thinking Through Many Plots}\label{examples-thinking-through-many-plots}}

An alumni of the MIDS program, and a former instructor of this course, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtoddyoung/}{Todd Young} built this nifty tool that lets us consider several different joint probability functions.

As a class, lets consider a few of these PDFs, beginning with this ``triangle'' distribution.

After considering the intuition for the triangle distribution, do the following: Write down the function that accords with the figure that you're seeing above.\footnote{Notice, that in general, this kind of \emph{curve fitting} isn't really a common data science task. Instead, this is just a learning task that lets the class assess their understanding of the definitions of random variables.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is a full statement of the PDF of this image?
\item
  What is the marginal distribution of \(X\), \(f_{X}(x)\)?
\item
  What is the marginal distribution of \(Y\), \(f_{Y}(y)\)?
\item
  Using the definition of independence, are \(X\) and \(Y\) independent of each other?
\item
  What is the CDF of \(X\), \(F_{X}(x)\)?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{saddle-sores}{%
\subsection{Saddle Sores}\label{saddle-sores}}

Suppose that you know that two random variables, \(X\) and \(Y\) are jointly distributed with the following \emph{pdf}:

\[
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 
  \begin{cases}
    a * x^{2} * y^{2} & 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1 \\
    0 & otherwise
  \end{cases}
\]

This joint pdf is similar to the pdf that you can visualize above, under the distribution called ``saddle''. The difference between this function and the image above is that the function bounds the with support of \(x\) and \(y\) on the range \([0,1]\). This is to make the math easier for us in the next step.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can you use these facts to determine the following?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What value of \(a\) makes this a valid joint pdf?
  \item
    What is the marginal pdf of \(x\)? That is, what is \(f_{x}(x)\)?
  \item
    What is the conditional pdf of \(X\) given \(Y\)? That is, what is \(f_{x|y}(x,y)\)?
  \item
    Given these facts, would you say that \(X\) and \(Y\) are dependent or independent?
  \item
    If the support for this joint distribution were instead \([0,4]\) (rather than \([0,1]\)), how would the shape of the distribution change?
  \end{itemize}

\hypertarget{computing-different-distributions.}{%

Suppose that random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are jointly continuous, with joint density function given by,

\[
f(x,y) = 
  \begin{cases}

    0, & otherwise
\end{cases}
\]

where \(c\) is a constant.

\item
  Draw a graph showing the region of the X-Y plane with positive probability density.
\item
  What is the constant \(c\)?
\item

\item
  Compute the conditional density function for \(Y\), conditional on \(X=x\). (Be sure to specify for what values of \(x\) this is defined)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{conditional-probability}{%
\section{Conditional Probability}\label{conditional-probability}}

Conditional probability is \textbf{incredible}. In fact, without exaggeration, almost \textbf{all} of data science is an exercise in making statements about conditional probability distributions. \emph{Don't believe us?}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the goal of a ``customer churn'' model or a conversion model?
\item
  What is the goal of a language-completion model?
\item
  What is the goal of flight-departures model?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If} we possessed the whole information about a process; \textbf{if} we had the CDF that governed probability of occurrences, what kinds of statements would we be able to make? Would we even need data?

Using the distribution above, produce a statement of conditional probability, \(f_{Y|X}(y|x)\).

\hypertarget{visualizing-distributions-via-simulation}{%
\section{Visualizing Distributions Via Simulation}\label{visualizing-distributions-via-simulation}}

To this point in the course, we have focused on concepts in ``the population'' with no reference to samples. This is on purpose! We want to develop the theory that defines the \textbf{best possible} predictor if we knew \textbf{everything} (if we know formula of the function that maps from \(\omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), and we know the probability of each \(\omega \in \Omega\) then we know everything). Beginning in week 5 of the course, we will talk about ``approximating'' (which we will call estimating) this best possible predictor with a limited sample of data.

However, at this point, to help build your working understanding, or intuition, for what is happening, we are going to work on a way to \emph{simulate} draws from a population. In some places, people might refer to these as \emph{Monte Carlo} methods -- this is because the method was developed by von Neumann \& Ulam during World War II, and they needed a way to talk about it using a code name. They chose \emph{Monte Carlo} after a famous casino in Monaco.

\hypertarget{example-the-uniform-distribution}{%
\subsection{Example: The Uniform Distribution}\label{example-the-uniform-distribution}}

\begin{quote}
You: ``Gosh. There sure are a lot of examples that use the uniform distribution. That must be a really important statistical distribution.''

Instructor: ``Nah. Not really. We're just using the uniform a bunch so that we don't get too lost in doing math while we're working with these concepts.''
\end{quote}

We'll start with a simple uniform distribution, but then we'll make it a little more complex in a moment.

We can use R to simulate draws from a probability distribution function by providing it with the name of the distribution that we're considering, the support of that distribution, or other features of the distribution. In the case of the uniform, the entire distribution is can be described just from it support.

So, suppose that you had a uniform distribution that had positive probability on the range \([1.1, 4.3]\). Why these? No particular reason. That is, suppose

\[
  f_{X}(x) = \begin{cases} 
    a & 1.1 \leq x \leq 4.3 \\ 
    0 & otherwise
  \end{cases}
\]

What does this distribution ``look like''? Because it is a uniform, you might have a sense that it will be a horizontal line. But, what is the height of that line? Aha! We could do the math to figure it out, or we could generate an approximation using a simulation.

In the code below, we are going to create an object called \texttt{samples\_uniform} that stores the results of the \texttt{runif} function call.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{samples\_uniform }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{runif}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n=}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{min=}\FloatTok{1.1}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{max=}\FloatTok{4.3}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What is happening inside \texttt{runif}?

When you're writing you own code, you can pull up the documentation for this (and any) function using a question mark, i.e.~\texttt{?}, followed by the function name -- \texttt{?runif}.

But, we can speed this up slightly by simply telling you that \texttt{n} is the number of samples to take from the population; \texttt{min} is the low-end of the support, and \texttt{max} is the high-end of the support.

If we look into this object, we can see the results of the function call. Below, we will show the first \(20\) elements of the \texttt{samples\_uniform} object.

This leaves us with two options: either, we might reduce the resolution that we're using to view this pattern, or we might take more samples and hold the resolution constant.

\subsection{Example: The Normal Distribution}\label{example-the-normal-distribution}}

Folks might have some prior beliefs about the Normal distribution. Don't worry, we'll cover this later in the course. But, this is the distribution that you have in mind when you're thinking of a ``bell curve''.

We can use the same method to visualize a normal distribution as we did for a uniform distribution. In this case, we would issue the call \texttt{rnorm}, together with the population parameters that define the population. At this point in the course, we do not expect that you will know these (and, actually memorizing these facts are not a core focus of the course), but you can \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution}{look them up} if you like. Truthfully, statistics wikipedia is \emph{very} good.

Do do you notice anything about the \texttt{runif} and the \texttt{rnorm} calls that we have identified? Both seem to name the distribution: \(unif \approx uniform\) and \(norm \approx normal\), but prepened with a \texttt{r}? This is for ``random draw''.

Base R is loaded with a \emph{pile} of basic statistics distributions, which you can look into using \texttt{?distributions}.

Finally, suppose that \(C = A + 2B\).

\chapter{Summarizing Distributions}\label{summarizing-distributions}}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/yosemite.jpg}
\caption{a majestic valley}
\end{figure}

In the last live session, we introduced random variables; probability density and cumulative density; and, made the connection between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions. All of these concepts work with the \textbf{entire} distribution.

Take, for example, the idea of conditional probability. We noted that conditional probability is defined to be:

\[
  f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f_{Y,X}(y,x)}{f_{X}(x)}
\]

This is a powerful concept that shows a lot of the range of the reasoning system that we've built to this point! The probability distribution of \(Y\) might change as a result of changes in \(X\). If you unpack that just a little bit more, we might say that \(f_{Y|X}(y|x)\) -- the probability density of \(Y\) -- which is itself a function, is \emph{also} a function of \(X\). To say it again, to be very explicit: the function is a function of another input. That might sound wild, but it is all perfectly consistent with the world that we've built to this point.

This concept is \textbf{very} expressive. Knowing \(f_{Y}(y)\) gives a full information representation of a variable; knowing \(f_{Y|X}(y|x)\) lets you update that information to make an even more informative statement about \(Y\). In \emph{Foundations} and at this point in the class, we deal only with conditional probability conditioning on a single variable, but the process generalizes.

For example, if there were four random variables, \(A, B, C, D\), we could make a statement about \(A\) that conditions on \(B, C, D\):

\[
  f_{A|\{B,C,D\}}(a|\{b,c,d\}) = \frac{f_{A,B,C,D}(a,b,c,d)}{f_{B,C,D}(b,c,d)}
\]

In this week's materials we are going to go in the \emph{opposite} direction: Rather than producing a very expressive system of probabilities, we're going to attempt to summarize all of the information contained in a pdf into lower-dimensional representations. Our first task will be summarizing a single random variable in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Where is the ``center'' of the random variable; and,
\item
  How dispersed, ``on average'' is the random variable from this center.
\end{enumerate}

After developing the concepts of \emph{expectation} and \emph{variance} (which are 1 \& 2 above, respectively), we will develop a summary of a joint distribution: the \emph{covariance}. The particular definitions that we choose to call expectation, variance, and covariance require justification. Why should we use these \emph{particular} formulae as measures of the ``center'' and ``dispersion''?

We ground these summaries in the \textbf{Mean Squared Error} evaluative metric, as well as justifying this metric.

\hypertarget{todays-lesson}{%
\subsection{Today's Lesson}\label{todays-lesson}}

What might seem frustrating about this probability theory system of reasoning is that we are building a castle in the sky -- a fiction. We're supposing that there is some function that describes the probability that values are generated. In reality, there is no such generative function; it is \emph{extremely unlikely} (though we'll acknowledge that it is possible) that the physical reality we believe we exist within is just a complex simulation that has been programmed with functions by some unknown designer.

Especially frustrating is that we're supposing this function, and then we're further saying,

\begin{quote}
``If only we had this impossible function; and if only we also had the ability to take an impossible derivative of this impossible function, then we could\ldots{}''
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{single-number-summaries-of-a-single-random-variable}{%
\subsubsection{Single number summaries of a single random variable}\label{single-number-summaries-of-a-single-random-variable}}

But, here's the upshot!

\textbf{What we are doing today is laying the baseline for models that we will introduce next week.} Here, we are going to suggest that there are radical simplifications that we can produce that hold specific guarantees, no matter how complex the function that we're reasoning about.

In particular, in one specific usage of the term \emph{best} we will prove that the Expectation operation is the best one-number summary of any distribution. To do so, we will define a term, \emph{variance}, which is the squared deviations from the expectation of a variable that describes how ``spread out'' is a variable. Then, we will define a concept that is the \emph{mean squared error} that is the square of the distance between a model prediction and a random variable's realization. The key realization is that when the model predicts the expectation, then the MSE is equal to the variance of the random variable, which is the smallest possible value it could realize.

\hypertarget{single-number-summaries-of-relationships-between-random-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Single number summaries of relationships between random variables}\label{single-number-summaries-of-relationships-between-random-variables}}

Although the single number summaries are \textbf{incredibly} powerful, that's not enough for today's lesson! We're also going to suggest that we can create a measure of linear dependence between two variables that we call the ``covariance'', and a related, re-scaled version of this relationship that is called the correlation.

One of our most fundamental goals as data scientists is to produce predictions that are \emph{good}. In this week's async, we make a statement of performance that we can use to evaluate how good a job a predictor is doing, choosing Mean Squared Error.

With the goal of minimizing \(MSE\), then we then present, justify, and prove that the conditional expectation function (\emph{the CEF}) is the globally best possible predictor. This is an incredibly powerful result, and one that serves as the backstop for \textbf{every} other predictor that you will ever fit, whether that predictor is a ``simple'' regression, or that predictor is a machine learning algorithms (e.g.~a random forest) or a deep learning algorithm. Read that again:

\begin{quote}
Even the most technologically advanced machine learning algorithms \emph{cannot possibly} perform better than the conditional expectation function at making a prediction.
\end{quote}

Why does the CEF do so well? Because it can contain a \emph{vast} amount of complex information and relationships; in fact, the complexity of the CEF is a product of the complexity of the underlying probability space. If that is the case, then why don't we just use the CEF as our predictor every time?

Well, this is one of the core problems of applied data science work: we are never given the function that describes the behavior of the random variable. And so, we're left in a world where we are forced to produce predictions from simplifications of the CEF. A very strong simplification, but one that is useful for our puny human brains, is to restrict ourselves to predictors that make predictions from a linear combination of input variables.

Why should we make such a strong restriction? After all, the conditional expectation function might be a fantastically complex combination of input features, why should we entertain functions that are only linear combinations? Essentially, this is because we're limited in our ability to reason about anything more complex than a linear combination.

This week, in the async reading and lectures we added a new concept, the conditional expectation of \(Y\) given \(X=x \in \text{Supp}[X]\):

A statistical functional is a function of a function that maps to a real number. So, if \(T\) is the functional that we're thinking of, \(\mathcal{F}\) is a family of functions that it might operate on, and \(\mathbb{R}\) is the set of real numbers, a statistical functional is just \(T: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\).

\[
f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{x}, & 0 \leq y \leq x \\

\item
  What is the conditional expectation of \(Y\), given that \(X=x=0\)?

\subsection{Minimizing MSE}\label{minimizing-mse}}

Theorem 2.2.20 states,

\begin{quote}
The CEF \(E[Y|X]\) is the ``best'' predictor of \(Y\) given \(X\), where ``best'' means it has the smallest mean squared error (MSE).
\end{quote}

Oh yeah? As a breakout group, \emph{ride shotgun} with us as we prove that the conditional expectation is the function that produces the smallest possible Mean Squared Error.

Specifically, \textbf{you group's task} is to justify every transition from one line to the next using concepts that we have learned in the course: definitions, theorems, calculus, and algebraic operations.

\hypertarget{the-pudding-aka-where-the-proof-is}{%
\subsection{The pudding (aka: ``Where the proof is'')}\label{the-pudding-aka-where-the-proof-is}}

We need to find such function \(g(X): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that gives the smallest mean squared error.

First, let MSE be defined as it is in \textbf{Definition 2.1.22}.

\begin{quote}
For a random variable \(X\) and constant \(c \in \mathbb{R}\), the \emph{mean squared error} of \(X\) about \(c\) is \(E[(x-c)^2]\).
\end{quote}

Second, let us note that since \(g(X)\) is just a function that maps onto \(\mathbb{R}\), that for some particular value of \(X=x\), \(g(X)\) maps onto a constant value.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Deriving a Function to Minimize MSE
\end{itemize}

\[
\begin{aligned}
  E[(Y - g(X))^2|X]
      &= E[Y^2 - 2Yg(X) + g^2(X)|X]                                \\
      &= E[Y^2|X] + E[-2Yg(X)|X] + E[g^2(X)|X]                     \\
      &= E[Y^2|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)E[1|X]                     \\
      &= (E[Y^2|X] - E^2[Y|X]) + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X)) \\
      &= V[Y|X] + (E^2[Y|X] - 2g(X)E[Y|X] + g^2(X))                \\
      &= V[Y|X] + (E[Y|X] - g(X))^2                                \\
\end{aligned} 
\]

Notice too that we can use the \emph{Law of Iterated Expectations} to do something useful. (This is a good point to talk about how this theorem works in your breakout groups.)

\[
\begin{aligned}
  E[(Y-g(X))^2] &= E\big[E[(Y-g(X))^2|X]\big]     \\ 
    &=E\big[V[Y|X]+(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2\big]           \\
    &=E\big[V[Y|X]\big]+E\big[(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2\big]\\
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(E[V[Y|X]]\) doesn't depend on \(g\); and,
\item
  \(E[(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2] \geq 0\).
\end{itemize}

\(\therefore g(X) = E[Y|X]\) gives the smallest \(E[(Y-g(X))^2]\)

Why Linear?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In some cases, we might try to estimate the CEF. More commonly, however, we work with linear predictors. Why?
\item
  We don't know joint density function of \(Y\). So, it is ``difficult'' to derive a suitable CEF.
\item
  To estimate \emph{flexible} functions requires considerably more data. Assumptions about distribution (e.g.~a linear form) allow you to leverage those assumptions to learn `more' from the same amount of data.
\item
  Other times, the CEF, even if we \emph{could} produce an estimate, might be so complex that it isn't useful or would be difficult to work with.
\item
  And, many times, linear predictors (which might seem trivially simple) actually do a very good job of producing predictions that are `close' or useful.
\end{itemize}

This week, we're coming into the big turn in the class, from probability theory to sampling theory.

In the probability theory section of the course, we developed the \emph{theoretically} \textbf{best} possible set of models. Namely, we said that if our goal is to produce a model that minimizes the Mean Squared Error that \emph{expectation} and \emph{conditional expectation} are as good as it gets. That is, if we only have the outcome series, \(Y\), we cannot possibly improve upon \(E[Y]\), the expectation of the random variable \(Y\). If we have additional data on hand, say \(X\) and \(Y\), then the best model of \(Y\) given \(X\) is the conditional expectation, \(E[Y|X]\).

We have also said that because this conditional expectation function might be complex, and hard to inform with data, that we might also be interested in a principled simplification of the conditional expectation function -- the simplification that requires our model be a line.

With this simplification in mind, we derived the linear system that produces the minimum MSE: the ratio of covariance between variables to variance of the predictor:

\[
  \beta_{BLP} = \frac{Cov[Y,X]}{V[X]}. 
\]

We noted, quickly, that the simple case of only two variables -- an outcome and a single predictor -- generalizes nicely into the (potentially very) many dimensional case. If the many-dimensional \(BLP\) is denoted as \(g(\mathbf{X}) = b_{0} + b_{1}X_{1} + \dots + b_{k}X_{k}\), then we can arrive at the sloped between one particular predictor, \(X_{k}\), and the outcome, \(Y\), as:

\[
  b_{k} = \frac{\partial g(\mathbf{X})}{\partial X_{k}}. 
\]

  First, we're going to develop a testing framework that is built on sampling theory and reference distributions: these are the \textbf{frequentist tests}.

\hypertarget{where-weve-been-random-variables-and-probability-theory}{%
\subsubsection{Where We've Been -- Random Variables and Probability Theory}\label{where-weve-been-random-variables-and-probability-theory}}

Statisticians create a model (also known as the population model) to represent the world. This model exists as joint probability densities that govern the probabilities that any series of events occurs at the same time. This joint probability of outcomes can be summarized and described with lower-dimensional summaries like the expectation, variance, covariance. While the expectation is a summary that contains information on about one marginal distribution (i.e.~the outcome we are interested in) we can produce predictive models that update, or \emph{condition} the expectation based on other random variables. This summary, the \textbf{conditional expectation} is the best possible (measured in terms of minimizing mean squared error) predictor of an outcome. We might simplify this conditional expectation predictor in many ways; the most common is to simplify to the point that the predictor is constrained to be a line or plane. This is known as the Best Linear Predictor.

\hypertarget{key-terms-and-assumptions}{%
\section{Key Terms and Assumptions}\label{key-terms-and-assumptions}}

\hypertarget{iid}{%
\subsection{IID}\label{iid}}

We use an abbreviation for the sampling process that under girds our frequentist statistics. That abbreviation, \textbf{IID}, while short, contains two powerful requirements of our data sampling process.

\begin{definition}

IID sampling is:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Independent}. The first \textbf{I} in the abbreviation, this independence requirement is similar to the independence concept that we've used in the probability theory section of the course. When samples are independent, the result of any one sample is not informative about the value of any of the other samples.
\item
  \textbf{Identically Distributed}. The \textbf{ID} in the abbreviation, this requirement means that all samples are drawn from the same distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

It might be tempting to imagine that IID samples are just \emph{``random samples''}, but it is worth noting that IID sampling has the two specific requirements noted above, and that these requirements are more stringent than a ``randomness'' criteria.

When we are thinking about IID samples, and evaluating whether the sample do, in point of fact, meet both of the requirements, it is \emph{crucial} to make an explicit statement about the reference population that is under consideration.

For example, suppose that you were interested in learning about life-satisfaction and your reference population are the peoples who live in the United States. Further, suppose that you decide to produce an estimate of this using a sample drawn from UC Berkeley undergraduate students during \href{https://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/rrr_guidelines.pdf}{RRR week}? There are several flaws in this design:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  There is a key \textbf{research design} issue: a sample drawn from Berkeley undergraduates is going to be \emph{essentially} uninformative of a US resident reference population!
\item
  There is a key \textbf{statistical} issue: the population of Berkeley undergraduates are not really an independent sample from the entire US resident reference population. Once you learn the age of someone from the Berkeley student population, you can make an conditional guess about the age of the next sample that will be closer than was possible before the first sample. The same goes for life-satisfaction: When you learn about the life-satisfaction from the first undergrad (who is miserable because they have their Stat 140 final coming up) while they are studying for their finals) you can make a conditionally better guess about the satisfaction of the next undergrad.
\end{enumerate}

Notice that these violations of the IID requirements only arise because our reference population is the US resident population. If, instead, the reference population were ``Berkeley undergrads'' then the sampling process \emph{would} satisfy the requirements of an IID process.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How, or why, can a change in the reference population make an identical sampling process move from one that we can consider IID to one that we cannot consider IID?
\end{itemize}

\item
  Second, for a specific case: Define the ``sample average'' to be the following: \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\). Prove that this sample average estimator is an unbiased estimator of \(E[X]\).
\item
  Third (easier), for a different specific case: Define the ``smample smaverage'' to be the following \(\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\). Prove that the smample smaverage is a biased estimator of \(E[X]\).
\item
  Fourth (harder): Define the geometric mean to be \[\left(\prod_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\right)^{\frac{1}{N}}\]. Prove that the geometric mean is a biased estimator of \(E[X]\).

Is this sample average an unbiased estimator for the population expected value? How do you know?

\hypertarget{estimator-property-consistency}{%
\section{Estimator Property: Consistency}\label{estimator-property-consistency}}

\emph{Foundations} makes another of their jokes when they write, on page 105,

\begin{quote}
``Consistency is a simple notion: if we had enough data, the probability that our estimate \(\hat{\theta}\) would be far from the truth, \(\theta\), would be small.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{How do we determine if a particular estimator, \(\hat{\theta}\) is a consistent estimator for our parameter of interest?}

There are at least two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The estimator is unbiased, and has a sampling variance that decreases as we add data; or,
\item
  We can use Chebyshev's to place a bound on the estimator, showing that as we add data, the estimator converges in probability to \(\theta\).
\end{enumerate}

The first notion of convergence requires an understanding of sampling variance:

The sampling variance of an estimator is a statement about how much dispersion due to random sampling, is present in the estimator. We defined the variance of a random variable to be \(E\left[(X - E[X])^{2}\right]\), The sampling variance uses this same definition, but we work with it slightly differently when we are considering sampling variance.

In particular, when we are considering sampling variance, we do not typically got as far as actually computing the variance of the underlying random variable? \emph{Why?} Because, if we're working in a sampling scenario, it is unlikely that we have access to the underlying function that governs the PDF of the random variable.

Instead, we typically start from a statement of the estimator that is under consideration, and apply the variance operator against that estimator. Consider, for example, forming a statement about the sampling variance of the sample average.

Let \(\overline{X} \equiv\) ``sample average'' \(\equiv \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\) be the normal form of the sample average.

Earlier, we proved that \(\overline{X}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(E[X]\).

What is the sampling variance of the sample average?

\vspace{20cm}

Using the statement that you have just produced, would you say that the sample average is a consistent estimator for the population expectation of a random variable?

\hypertarget{understanding-sampling-distributions}{%
\section{Understanding Sampling Distributions}\label{understanding-sampling-distributions}}

How do sampling distributions change as we add data to them? This is going to both motivate convergence, and also play forward into the Central Limit Theorem.
Let's work through an example that begins with a case that we can think through and draw ourselves. Once we feel pretty good about the \emph{very} small sample, then we will rely on R to do the work when we expand the example beyond what we can draw ourselves.

Suppose that \(X\) is a Bernoulli random variable representing an unfair coin. Suppose that the coin has a 70\% chance of coming up heads: \(P(X=1) = 0.7\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To begin, suppose that you take that coin, and you toss it two times: you have an iid sample of size 2, \((X_1,X_2)\).
\item
  \emph{What is the sampling distribution of the sample average, of this sample of size two?}
\item
  On the axes below, draw the probability distribution of \(\overline X = \frac{X_1+X_2}{2}\).
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{203-live-session_files/figure-latex/make axes-1.pdf}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What if you took four samples? What would the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\) look like? \emph{Draw this onto the axis above.}
\item
  Explain the difference between a population distribution and the sampling distribution of a statistic.
\item
  Why do we want to know things about the sampling distribution of a statistic?
\end{itemize}

We are going to write a function that, essentially, just wraps a built-in function with a new name and new function arguments. This is, generally, bad coding practice -- because it is changing the default lexicon than a collaborator needs to be aware of -- but it is useful for teaching purposes here.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{number\_of\_simulations} argument to the \texttt{toss\_coin} function basically just adjusts the precision of our simulation study.

\hypertarget{write-code-to-demo-the-central-limit-theorem-clt}{%
\section{Write Code to Demo the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)}\label{write-code-to-demo-the-central-limit-theorem-clt}}

When you were reading for this week, did you sense the palpable \emph{joy} of the authors when they were writing about the central limit theorem?

\begin{quote}
We now preset what is often considered the most profound and important theorem in statistics.
\end{quote}

Wow. What excitement.

On its own, the result that \emph{across a broad range of generative functions the distribution of sample averages converges in distribution to follow a normal distribution} would be a statistical curiosity. Along the lines of ``did you know that dinosaurs might have had feathers,'' or, ``avocado trees reproduce using 'protogynous dichogamy''. While these factoids might be useful on your quiz-bowl team, they don't get us very far down the line as practicing data scientists.

However, there is a \textbf{very} useful consequence of this convergence in distribution that we will explore in detail over the coming two weeks: because \emph{so many} distributions produce sample averages that converge in distribution to a normal distribution, we can put together a testing framework for sample averages that works for an \emph{agnostic} set of random variables. Wait for that next week, but know that there's a reason that we're as excited about this statement as we are.

\hypertarget{part-1}{%
\subsection{Part 1}\label{part-1}}

To begin with, we will use fair coins that have an equal probability landing heads and tails.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Modify the function argument below so that it conduct \textbf{one} simulations, and in each simulation tosses \textbf{ten} coins, each with an \textbf{equal} probability of landing heads and tails. Look into the \texttt{toss\_coin} function: is there a point that this function is producing a sample average? If so, where?
\item
  Save values from the \texttt{toss\_coin} function into an object, called \texttt{sample\_mean}.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# toss\_coin()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The sample mean is a random variable -- it is a function that maps from a random generative process' sample space (the number of heads shown on dice) to the real numbers. To try to make this clear, visualize a larger number of simulations on the \texttt{toss\_coin} function. That is, increase the \texttt{number\_of\_simulations} to be 10, or 100. and plot a histogram of the results. This is quite similar to what we have done earlier.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# toss\_coin()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you replicate the simulation with \textbf{ten} coins enough times, will the distribution ever look normal? Why or why not?

\hypertarget{part-2}{%
\subsection{Part 2}\label{part-2}}

For this part, we'll continue to study a fair coin.

What happens if you change the number of coins that you're tossing? Here, set \texttt{number\_of\_simulations=1000}, and examine what happens if you alter the number of coins that you're tossing? Is there a point where this distribution starts to ``look normal'' to you? (Later in the semester, we'll formalize a test for this ``looks normal'' concept).

What would happen if the coin was very, very unfair? For this part, study a coin that has a \texttt{prob\_heads=0.01}. This is an example of a highly skewed random variable.

Start your study here tossing three coins, \texttt{number\_of\_coins=3}. What does this distribution look like?

What happens as you increase the number of coins that you're tossing? Is there a point that the distribution starts to look normal?

\section{Errors with Standard Errors}\label{errors-with-standard-errors}}

Talking about variance and sampling variance is hard, because the terms sound \textbf{very} similar, but have important distinctions in what they mean. For example, the ``variance'' is not the same as the ``unbiased sample variance'' which is also not the same as the ``sampling variance of the sample average''. :sob:

Standard errors are a statement about the sampling variance of the sample average. But, related to this concept are the ideas of the \emph{Population Variance}, the \emph{Plug-In Estimator for the Sample Variance}, the \emph{Unbiased Sample Variance}, and, finally, the \emph{Sampling Variance of the Sample Average} (i.e the \emph{Standard Error}).

How are each of these concepts related to one another, and how can we keep them all straight? As a group, fill out the following columns?

For the \textbf{Estimator Properties} column, here we're considering, principally biased/unbiased and consistent/inconsistent.

Frequentist Hypothesis testing is a very well established framework in the applied practice, and scientific literature. Sometimes (often, currently) referred to as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), this framework essentially makes an absurd assertion and asks the data to overturn that assertion.

Like a petulant child, NHST essentially proclaims,

\begin{quote}
``If you really loved me, you would let me watch this screen one-hundred hours every day.''
\end{quote}

Here the absurdity is that a parent might not love their child, and the criteria to overturn that assertion is noted to be ``buy me an iPad'''.

\hypertarget{what-is-frequentist-testing-doing}{%
\subsection*{What is Frequentist testing doing?}\label{what-is-frequentist-testing-doing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{What is Frequentist testing doing?}

This testing framework works on \textbf{samples} of data, and applies \textbf{estimators} to produce \textbf{estimates} of \textbf{population parameters} that are fundamentally unknown and unknowable. Despite this unknown and unknowable population target, with some carefully written down estimators we can rely on the convergence characteristics of some estimators to produce \emph{useful}, \emph{reliable} results.

We begin with the one-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test relies on the sample average as an estimator of a population expectation. In doing so, it relies on the effectiveness of the \textbf{Weak Law of Large Numbers} and the \textbf{Central Limit Theorem} to guarantee that the estimator that \textbf{converges in probability} to the population expectation, while also \textbf{converging in distribution} to a Gaussian distribution.

These two convergence concepts permit a data scientist to make several \textbf{inferences} based on data:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability of generating data that \emph{``looks like what is observed''}, if the null-hypothesis were true. This is often referred to as the \textbf{p-value} of a test, and is the petulant statement identified above.
\item
  An interval of values that, with some stated probability (e.g.~95\%), contains the true population parameter.
\end{enumerate}

This framework begins a \textbf{exceedingly important} task that we must understand, and undertake when we are working as data scientists: Producing our best-estimate, communicating how we arrived at that estimate, what (if any) guarantees that estimate provides, and \emph{crucially} all \textbf{limitations} of our estimate.

\item
  Statisticians create a model to represent the world
\item
  We saw examples of estimators, which approximate model parameters we're interested in.
\item
  By itself, an estimate isn't much good; we need to capture the uncertainty in the estimate.
\item
  We've seen two ways to express uncertainty in an estimator: standard errors and confidence intervals.

In the async content for the week, we're really, \emph{really} clear that we're only working with the \emph{t-distribution}. But, the general ``form'' of a frequentist hypothesis test is always the same: produce a test statistic; produce a distribution of that test statistic if the null hypothesis \emph{were} true; then compare the two. Let's stretch this application a little bit.

There is a theory that upcoming tests cause students to fall ill.~We have been collecting wellness data from our students for several years (not really\ldots) and we have found the following distribution of illnesses (Notice that this does not tell you anything about how many students we have enrolled over the years):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  20 students have reported being ill in the week \emph{before} Test 2
\item
  10 students have reported being ill in the week \emph{after} Test 2
\end{itemize}

Think of wellness/illness as a dichotomous statement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{State an appropriate null hypothesis.} After you have stated this null hypothesis, can you think about (or, even better) can you produce a distribution of the probability of \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots{} 30\} of the illnesses reported before the test?

\textbf{t-Test Micro Cheat Sheet}

In order for a t-test to produce valid results, a set of conditions must be satisfied. While the literature refers to these as \emph{assumptions}, you might do better to refer to these for yourselves as \emph{requirements}. Meaning, if these requirements for the data generating process are not satisfied, the test does not produce results that hold any statistical guarantees.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Metric variable}: The data needs to be numeric

Of course, because we don't get access to the function that describes the random variable, we can't \emph{actually} know if the populations are different. It is for this reason that we call it statistical inference -- we are inferring from a sample some belief about the populations.

Data science is a \emph{beautiful} combination of team-work and individual-work. It provides the opportunity to work together on a data pipeline with people from all over the organization, to deal with technical, statistical, and social questions that are always interesting. While we expect that everyone on a team will be a professional, there is so much range within the pursuit of data science that projects are nearly always collaborative exercises.

Together as teams, we

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define research ambitions and scope
\item
  Imagine/envision the landscape of what is possible
\item
  Support, discuss, review and integrate individual contributions
\end{itemize}

Together as individuals we conduct the heads-down work that moves question answering forward. This might be reading papers to determine the most appropriate method to bring to bear on the question, or researching the data that is available, or understanding the technical requirements that we have to meet for this answer to be useful to our organization in real time.

What is your instructor \emph{uniquely} capable of? Let them tell you! But, at the same time, what would they acknowledge that others are better than them?

See, the thing is, because there is so much that has to be done, there literally are very, very few people who are one-stop data science shops. Instead, teams rely on collaboration and joint expertise in order to get good work done.

These emotions are common through data science, academics, computer science. But, these types of emotions are also commonplace in journalism, film-making, and public speaking.

Has anybody ever had the dream that they're late to a test? Or, that that they've got to give a speech that they're unprepared for? Does anybody remember playing an instrument as a kid and having to go to recitals? Or, play for a championship on a youth sports team? Or, go into a test two?

``Psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk. It is a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive.''

``In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea.''

With this plot created, we can ask if what we observe in the plot is the produce of what could just be sampling error, or if this is something that was unlikely to arise due if the null hypothesis were true. What is the null hypothesis? Well, lets suppose that if we didn't know anything about the data that we would expect there to be no difference between the amount of time spent with friends or families.

\subsection{Should we use a t-test or a wilcox sign-rank?}\label{should-we-use-a-t-test-or-a-wilcox-sign-rank}}

There is some open discussion in the applied statistics literature about whether we should \emph{ever} be using a t-test. In particular, if the underlying distribution that generates the data is \textbf{not} normal, than the assumptions of a t-test are not, technically satisfied and the test does not produce results that have nominal p-value coverage. This is both \emph{technically} and \emph{theoretically} true; and yet, researchers, data scientists, your instructors, and the entire world runs t-tests as ``test of first recourse.''

What is the alternative to conducting a t-test as the test of first recourse? It might be the Wilcox test. The Wilcox test makes a weaker assumption -- of symmetry around the mean or median -- which is weaker than the assumption of normality.

Additional points of argument, which you will investigate in this worksheet:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the underlying data \textbf{is} normal, then the Wilcox test is \emph{nearly} as well powered as the t-test.
\item
  If the underlying data \textbf{is not} normal, then the Wilcox test still maintains nominal p-value coverage, whereas the t-test might lose this guarantee.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Poisson Distribution}\label{the-poisson-distribution}}

The poisson distribution has the following PDF:

\[
f_X(x) = \frac{\lambda^n e^{-\lambda}}{n!}
\]

The key shape parameter for a poisson function is \(\lambda\); we show three different distributions, setting this shape parameter to be 1, 3, and 30 respectively. Notice that the limits on these plots are not set to be the same; for example, the range in the third plot is considerably larger than the first.

\textbf{Rear-View Mirror}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  Sometimes, the model includes an ``outcome'' random variable \(Y\) and ``input'' random variables \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\).
\item
  The joint distribution of \(Y\) and \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\) is complicated.
\item
  The best linear predictor (BLP) is the canonical way to summarize the relationship.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Today}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  OLS regression is an estimator for the BLP
\item
  We'll discuss the \emph{mechanics} of OLS
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To make regression estimates useful, we need measures of uncertainty (standard errors, tests\ldots).
\item
  The process of building a regression model looks different, depending on whether the goal is prediction, description, or explanation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{discussion-questions}{%
\section{Discussion Questions}\label{discussion-questions}}

Suppose we have random variables \(X\) and \(Y\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why do we care about the BLP?
\item
  What assumptions are needed for OLS to consistently estimate the BLP?
\item
  What assumptions are needed in terms of causality (\(X\) causes \(Y\), \(Y\) causes \(X\), etc.) in order to compute the regression of \(Y\) on \(X\)?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-regression-anatomy-formula}{%
\section{The Regression Anatomy Formula}\label{the-regression-anatomy-formula}}

We make the claim in live session that we can re-represent a coefficient that we're interested in as a function of all the other variable in a regression. That is, suppose that we were interested, initially, in estimating the model:

\[ 
Y = \hat\beta_{0} + \hat\beta_{1} X_{1} + \hat\beta_{2} X_{2} + \hat\beta_{3}X_{3} + e
\]
that we can produce an estimate for \(\hat\beta_{1}\) by fitting this auxiliary regression,

\[
X_{1} = \hat\delta_{0} + \hat\delta_2X_2 + \hat\delta_3X_3 + r_{1}
\]

And then using the residuals, noted as \(r_1\) above, in a second auxiliary regression,

\[ 
Y = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 r_1
\]

The claim that we make in the live session is that there is a guarantee that \(\beta_1 = \gamma_1\). Here, we are first going to show that this is true, and then we're going to reason about what this means, and why this feature is interesting (or at least useful) when we are estimating a regression.

Suppose that the population model is the following:

\[
Y = -3 + (1\cdot X_1) + (2\cdot X_2) + (3\cdot X_3)
\]

Notice that when we made this data, we included a set of random noise at the end. The idea here is that there are other ``things'' in this universe that also affect \(Y\), but that we don't have access to them.

In this next set of notes, we're going to give some data, displayed in plots, and we will try to apply what we have learned in the async and reading for this week to answer questions about each of the scatter plots.

\hypertarget{plot-1}{%
\subsection{Plot 1}\label{plot-1}}

Consider data that is generated according to the following function:

\[
  Y = 1 + 2x_1 + 3x_2 + e, 
\]

where \(x_1 \sim N(0,2)\), \(x_2 \sim N(0,2)\) and \(e\) is a constant equal to zero.

From this population, you might consider taking a sample of 100 observations, and representing this data in the following 3d scatter plot. In this plot, there are three dimensions, an \(x_1, x_2\), and \(y\) dimensions.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Rotate the cube and explore the data, looking at each face of the cube, including from the top down.
\item
  One of the lessons that we learned during the random variables section of the course is that every random variable that has been measured can also be marginalized off. You might think of this as ``casting down'' data from three dimensions, to only two.
\item
  Sketch the following 2d scatter plots, taking care the label your axes. You need not represent all 100 points, but rather create the \emph{gestalt} of what you see.\\
  1. \(Y = f(x_1)\) (but not \(x_2\))
  2. \(Y = f(x_2)\) (but not \(x_1\))
  3. \(x2 = f(x_1)\)
\item
  Once you have sketched the scatter plots, what line would you fit that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in the vertical direction. Define a residual, \(\epsilon\), to be the vertical distance between the line you draw, and the corresponding point on the input data.
\item
  What is the \emph{average} of the residuals for each of the lines that you have fitted? How does this correspond to the \emph{moment conditions} discussed in the async? What would happen if you translated this line vertically?
\item
  Rotate the cube so that the points ``fall into line''. When you see this line, how does it help you describe the function that governs this data?

\textbf{Rear-View Mirror}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  Sometimes, the model includes an ``outcome'' random variable \(Y\) and ``input'' random variables \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\).
\item
  The joint distribution of \(Y\) and \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\) is complicated.
\item
  The best linear predictor (BLP) is the canonical way to summarize the relationship.
\item
  OLS provides a point estimate of the BLP
\end{itemize}

\item
  Robust Standard Error: quantify the uncertainty of OLS coefficients
\item
  Hypothesis testing with OLS coefficients

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Regression is a foundational tool that can be applied to different contexts
\item
  The process of building a regression model looks different, depending on whether the goal is prediction, description, or explanation.

Imagine three different regression models, each of the following form:

\[
  Y = 0 + \beta X + \epsilon
\]

The only difference is in the error term. The conditional distribution is given by:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Model & Distribution of \(\epsilon\) cond. on \(X\) \\
\midrule
\endhead
A & Uniform on \([-.5, +.5]\) \\
B & Uniform on \([ - |X|, |X| ]\) \\
C & Uniform on \([ -1 + |X|, 1- |X| ]\) \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

A is what we call a homoskedastic distribution. B and C are what we call heteroskedastic. Below, we define R functions that simulate draws from these three distributions.

\subsection{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

You have a sample from each distribution, A, B, and C and you fit a regression of Y on X. Which will have the highest standard error for the slope coefficient? Which will have the lowest standard error? Why? (You may want to try experimenting with the function defined above)

\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\subsection{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

For distribution A, perform a simulated experiment. Draw a large number of samples, and for each sample fit a linear regression. Store the slope coefficient from each regression in a vector. Finally, compute the standard deviation for the slope coefficients.

Repeat this process for distributions B and C. Do the results match your intuition?

\hypertarget{understanding-uncertainty-1}{%
\section{Understanding Uncertainty}\label{understanding-uncertainty-1}}

Under the relatively stricter assumptions of constant error variance, the variance of a slope coefficient is given by

\[
  V(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_j (1-R_j^2)}
\]

\begin{definition}
A similar formulation is given in \emph{FOAS} as definition 4.2.3,

\[
  \hat{V}_{C}[\hat{\beta}] = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left( X^{T} X \right)^{-1} \rightsquigarrow \hat{\sigma}^{2}{\left(\mathbb{X}^{T}\mathbb{X}\right)}, 
\]
where \(\hat{\sigma}^{2} = V[\hat{epsilon}]\)
\end{definition}

Explain why each term makes the variance higher or lower:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of the error \(\epsilon\)
\item
  \(SST_j\) is (unscaled) variance of \(X_j\)
\item
  \(R_j^2\) is \(R^2\) for a regression of \(X_j\) on the other \(X\)'s

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate a new model (and save it into another object) that includes the size of the lot and whether the house is a colonial. This will estimate the model:
\end{enumerate}

\[
  price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial? + e
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{BUT BEFORE YOU DO}, make a prediction: What do you think is going to happen to the coefficient that relates square footage and price?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Will the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Will the \emph{uncertainty} about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Conduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model \emph{as a whole} does better when the coefficients on \texttt{colonial} and \texttt{lotsize} are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e.~\(\beta_{2} = \beta_{3} = 0\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Use the function \texttt{vcovHC} from the \texttt{sandwich} package to estimate (a) the the heteroskedastic consistent (i.e.~``robust'') variance covariance matrix; and (b) the robust standard errors for the intercept and slope of this regression. Recall, what is the relationship between the VCOV and SE in a regression?
\item
  Perform a hypothesis test to check whether the population relationship between \texttt{sqrft} and \texttt{price} is zero. Use \texttt{coeftest()} with the robust standard errors computed above.
\item
  Use the robust standard error and \texttt{qt} to compute a 95\% confidence interval for the coefficient \texttt{sqrft} in the second model that you estimated. \(price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial\).
\item
  \textbf{Bootstrap.} The book \emph{very} quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling \emph{with replacement} and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have.
\end{enumerate}

Below is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the \texttt{sqrft} variable when \texttt{lotsize} and \texttt{colonial} are included in the model.

\textbf{Omitted Variable Bias in R}

The file \texttt{htv.RData} contains data from the 1991 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, provided by Wooldridge. All people in the sample are males age 26 to 34. The data is interesting here, because it includes education, stored in the variable \texttt{educ}, and also a score on an ability test, stored in the variable \texttt{abil}.

Assume that the true model is,

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/wage_system.png}

\textbf{Questions:}

1- Are we able to \emph{directly} measure ability? If so, how would you propose to measure it?

2- If not, what \emph{do} we measure and how is this measurement related to ability? And there is a lot of evidence to suggest that standardized tests are not a very good proxy. But for now, let's pretend that we really are measuring ability.

3- Using R, estimate (a) the true model, and (b) the regression of ability on education.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Write down the expression for what omitted variable bias would be if you couldn't measure ability.
\item
  Add this omitted variable bias to the coefficient for education to see what it would be.
\end{itemize}

4- Now evaluate your previous result by fitting the model, \[wage = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 educ + w\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the coefficient for the relationship between education and wages match what you estimated earlier?
\item
  Why or why not?
\end{itemize}

5- Reflect on your results:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What does the direction of omitted variable bias suggest about OLS estimates of returns to education?
\item
  What does this suggest about the reported statistical significance of education?
\end{itemize}

\item
  Using the mtcars data, run a multiple linear regression to find the relationship between displacement (\texttt{disp}), gross horsepower (\texttt{hp}), weight (\texttt{wt}), and rear axle ratio (\texttt{drat}) on the miles per gallon (\texttt{mpg}).
\item
  For \textbf{each} of the following CLM assumptions, assess whether the assumption holds. Where possible, demonstrate multiple ways of assessing an assumption. When an assumption appears violated, state what steps you would take in response.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I.I.D. data
  \item
    Linear conditional expectation
  \item
    No perfect collinearity
  \item
    Homoskedastic errors
  \item
    Normally distributed errors
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In addition to the above, assess to what extent (imperfect) collinearity is affecting your inference.
\item
  Interpret the coefficient on horsepower.
\item
  Perform a hypothesis test to assess whether rear axle ratio has an effect on mpg. What assumptions need to be true for this hypothesis test to be informative? Are they?
\item
  Choose variable transformations (if any) for each variable, and try to better meet the assumptions of the CLM (which also maintaining the readability of your model).
\item
  (As time allows) report the results of both models in a nicely formatted regression table.

\hypertarget{discussion-3}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-3}}

\textbf{Status Update}
You have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You run 7 different t-tests, one for posts on Monday (versus all other days), or for Tuesday (versus all other days), etc. Only the test for Sunday is significant, with a p-value of .045, so you throw out the other tests.

Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts? (How can you address this situation responsibly when you publish your results?)

\textbf{Such Update}
As before, you have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You do a little EDA and notice that Sunday seems to have more ``status updates'' than all other days, so you recode your ``day of the week'' variable into a binary one: Sunday = 1, All other days = 0. You run a t-test and get a p-value of .045. Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Funday}
Suppose researcher A tests if Monday has an effect (versus all other days), Researcher B tests Tuesday (versus all other days), and so forth. Only Researcher G, who tests Sunday finds a significant effect with a p-value of .045. Only Researcher G gets to publish her work. If you read the paper, should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Repentence}
What if researcher G above is a sociologist that chooses to measure the effect of Sunday based on years of observing the way people behave on weekends? Researcher G is not interested in the other tests, because Sunday is the interesting day from her perspective, and she wouldn't expect any of the other tests to be significant.

\textbf{Decreasing Effect Sizes}
Many observers have noted that as studies yielding statistically significant results are repeated, estimated effect sizes go down and often become insignificant. Why is this the case?

\section{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}}

This exercise is meant to demonstrate what the confidence level in a confidence interval represents. We will assume a standard normal population distribution and simulate what happens when we draw a sample and compute a confidence interval.

Your task is to complete the following function so that it,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  simulates and stores\texttt{}n draws from a standard normal distribution
\item
  based on those draws, computes a valid confidence interval with confidence level \(\alpha\), a parameter that you pass to the function.
\end{enumerate}

Your function should return a vector of length 2, containing the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval.

\[
CI_{\alpha} = \overline{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(CI_\alpha\) is the confidence interval that you're seeking to produce
\item
  \(\overline{X}\) is the sample average,\\
\item
  \(t_{\alpha/2}\) is your critical value (accessible through \texttt{qt}),
\item
  and \(s\) is your sample standard deviation. Notice that you'll need each of these pieces in the code that you're about to write.
\end{itemize}

Suppose that you've got a particular sequence of values: \({1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\) that indicate whether a printer any particular time you try to print.

You have data from the last 10 times you tried.

\textbf{Part II}

The data resembles draws from a Bernoulli distribution.

However, even if we want to model this as a Bernoulli distribution, we do not know the value of the parameter, \(p\).

1- Define your random variable.

2- Write down the likelihood function

3- If it will make the math easier, log the likelihood function.

4- \emph{Path 1:} Maximize the likelihood using calculus

5- \emph{Path 2:} Maximize using numeric methods.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Bloom's Taxonomy}

An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as \emph{Bloom's Taxonomy}, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one \emph{level} of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning.

In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept \emph{is}, or why the concept works in the way that it does.
\item
  \textbf{Apply} A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem.
\item
  \textbf{Analyze} A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be.
\item
  \textbf{Evaluate} A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals.
\item
  \textbf{Create} A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.
\end{enumerate}
