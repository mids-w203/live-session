This is the live session work space for the course. Our goal with this repository, is that we're able to communicate \emph{ahead of time} our aims for each week, and that you can prepare accordingly.

\hypertarget{probability-spaces}{%
\chapter{Probability Spaces}\label{probability-spaces}}

Probability is a system of reasoning about the world in the face of incomplete information. In this course, we're going to develop an understanding of the implications of core parts of this theory, how this theory was developed, and how these implications relate to every other part of the practice of data science.

At the end of this week's learning, student will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Find} and \emph{access} all of the course materials;

\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-learning-objectives}{%
\section{Course Learning Objectives}\label{course-learning-objectives}}

At this point in the course, there is so much that is before us! As we settle in to study for the semester, it is useful to have a point of view of where we're trying to go, and what we are going to see along the way.

Allow a justification by analogy:

\begin{quote}
Suppose that you decide that you would like to be a chef -- all of the time watching cooking shows has revealed to you that this is your life's true calling -- and so you enroll in a culinary program.

One does not begin such a program by baking croissants and souffle. They begin the program with knife skills, breaking down ingredients and the basic techniques that build up to produce someone who is not a \emph{cook}, but a \emph{chef} -- someone who can combine ingredients and techniques to produce novel ideas.

At the same time, however, one has not gone to school just to become a cucumber slicer. The knife skills are instrumental to the eventual goal -- of being a chef -- but not the goal itself.
\end{quote}

At the beginning of the program, we're teaching these core, fundamental skills. How to read and reason with mathematical objects, how to use conditional probability with the goal of producing a model, and eventually, \textbf{eventually} to create novel work as a data scientist.

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

\subsection{Instructor Introductions}\label{instructor-introductions}}

The instructors for the course come to the program, and to statistics from different backgrounds. Instructors hold PhDs in statistics, astrophysics, biology, political science, computer science, and information.

\hypertarget{what-does-a-statistician-look-like-you}{%
\subsection{What does a statistician look like? You!}\label{what-does-a-statistician-look-like-you}}

Identity shapes how people approach and understand their world.

We would like to acknowledge that we have limited diversity of identity among the instructors for this course. We each have been fortunate to be able to study, but we want to acknowledge that the education system in the US has systematically benefited the hegemonic groups and marginalized others voices.

Every one of the instructors shares a core identity as an empathetic educator that wants to understand your strengths, areas for growth, and unique point of view that is shaped by who you are. We want to see a field of data scientists who embrace each others voices, and respects people for the identies that they hold.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It doesn't matter if you've never taken a stats class before, or if you're reviewing using this class. There will be challenges for everyone to overcome.
\item
  It doesn't matter how old or young you are. We will all be learning frequentist statistics which is timeless.
\item
  The color of your skin doesn't matter; nor does whether you identify as a woman or a man or trans or non-binary; neither does your sexual orientation. There are legacies of exclusion and discrimination against people due to these identities. We will not continue to propagate those legacies and instead will work to controvert those discriminations to build a diverse community of learning in line with the University's \href{https://diversity.berkeley.edu/principles-community}{Principles of Community}.

\hypertarget{student-introductions-breakout-one}{%

\textbf{Breakout One.} A \emph{name story} is the unique, and individual story that describes how you came to have the name that you do. While there may be many people are called the same thing, each of their name stories is unique.

Please share: \emph{What is your name story?}

\begin{breakout}
\textbf{Breakout Two.}
Like our names, the reasons that we joined this program, our goals and our histories are different.

Please share: \emph{What is your data science story? How did you wind up here, in this room today?}

\end{breakout}

\hypertarget{probability-theory}{%
\section{Probability Theory}\label{probability-theory}}

\textbf{Probability}

Probability is a system of reasoning that we use to model the world under incomplete information. This model underlies virtually \emph{every} other model you'll ever use as a data scientist.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./images/picard.jpg}
\caption{told you this would be spacey}
\end{figure}

In this course, probability theory builds out to random variables; when combined with sampling theory we are able to develop p-values (which are also random variables) and an inferential paradigm to communicate what we know and how certain a statement we can make about it.

In introduction to machine learning, literally the first model that you will train is a naive bayes classifier, which is an application of Bayes' Theorem, trained using an iterative fitting algorithm. Later in machine learning, you'll be fitting non-linear models, but at every point the input data that you are supplying to your models are generated from samples from random variables. That the world can be represented by random variables (which we will cover in the coming weeks) means that you can transform -- squeeze and smush, or stretch and pull -- variables to heighten different aspects of the variables to produce the most useful \emph{information} from your data.

As you move into NLP, you might think of generative text as a conditional probability problem: given some particular set of words as an input, what is the most likely \emph{next} word or words that someone might type?

Beyond the direct instrumental value that we see working with probability, there are two additional aims that we have in starting the course in the manner.

First, because we are starting with the axioms of probability as they apply to data science statistics, students in this course develop a \emph{much} fuller understanding of classical statistics than students in most other programs. Unfortunately, it is very common for students and then professionals to see statistics as a series of rules that have to be followed absolutely and without deviation. In this view of statistics, there are distributions to memorize; there are repeated problems to solve that require the rote application of some algebraic rule (i.e.~compute the sample average and standard deviation of some vector); and, there are myriad, byzantine statistical tests to memorize and apply. In this view of statistics, if the real-world problem that comes to you as a data scientist doesn't clearly fit into a box, there's no way to move forward.

\begin{quote}
Statistics like this is not fun.
\end{quote}

In the way that we are approaching this course, we hope that you're able to learn \emph{why} certain distributions (like the normal distribution) arise repeatedly, and why we can use them. We also hope that because you know how sampling theory and random variables combine, that you can be more creative and inventive to solve problems that you haven't seen before.

The second additional aim that we have for this course is that it can serve as either an introduction or a re-introduction to reading and making arguments using the language of math. For some, this will be a new language; for others, it may have been some years since they have worked with the language; for some, this will feel quite familiar. New algorithms and data science model advancements \emph{nearly always} developed in the math first, and then applied into algorithms second. In our view, being a literate reader of graduate- and professional-level math is a necessary skill for any data scientist that is going to keep astride of the field as it continues to develop and these first weeks of the course are designed to bring everyone back into reading and reasoning in the language.

\hypertarget{axiomatic-probability}{%
\section{Axiomatic Probability}\label{axiomatic-probability}}

The book makes a point of defining our axioms of probability, calling them them

\begin{definition}
\emph{Kolmogorov Axioms}

Let \(\Omega\) be a sample space, \(S\) be an event space, and \(P\) be a probability measure. Then, \((\Omega, S, P)\) is a \emph{probability space} if it satisfies the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Non-negativity: \(\forall A \in S, P(A) \geq 0\), where \(P(A)\) is finite and real.
\item
  Unitarity: \(P(\Omega)=1\).
\item
  Countable additivity: if \(A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots \in S\) are pairwise disjoint, then
\end{itemize}

\[
P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \dots) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) = \sum_{i}P(A_{i})
\]
\end{definition}

There is a lot going on in this definition!

First things first, these are the \textbf{axioms of probability} (read aloud in the booming voice of a god).

This means that these are things that we begin from, sort of the foundational principles of the entire system of reasoning that we are going to use. In the style of argument that we're going to make, these are things that are sort of off-limits to question. Instead, these serve as the grounding assumptions, and we see what happens as we flow forward from these statements.

Second, and importantly, from these axioms there are a \emph{very large} set of things that we can build. The first set of things that we will build are probability statements about atomic outcomes (Theorem 1.1.4 in the book), and collections of events. But, these statements, are not the only thing that we're limited to. We can also build \emph{Frequentist Statistics}, and \emph{Bayesian Statistics} and \emph{Language Models}.

In many ways, these axioms are the fundamental particles that hold our system of probabilistic reasoning together. These are to probability what the \emph{fermions} and and \emph{bosons} are to physics.

\hypertarget{definition-vs.-theorem}{%
\section{Definition vs.~Theorem}\label{definition-vs.-theorem}}

What is the difference between a definition and a theorem? On pages 10 and 11 of the textbook, there is a rapid fire collection of pink boxes. We reproduce them here (notice that they may have different index numbers than the book -- this live session book autoindexes and we're not including every theorem and definition in this live session discussion guide).

\begin{definition}
\emph{Conditional Probability} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(B) > 0\), the \emph{conditional probablity} of \(A\) given \(B\) is \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(B) > 0\), \[P(A|B)P(B) = P(A \cap B)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\emph{Baye's Rule} For \(A, B \in S\) with \(P(A) > 0\) and \(P(B) > 0\), \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{discussion-question}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What would happen to the statement of the \emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability} if we did not have the definition of \emph{Conditional Probability}?
\item
  How does one get from the definition, to the law?
\item
  Can one get to \emph{Baye's Rule} wihtout using the \emph{Multiplicative Law of Probability}?
\end{itemize}

\end{discussion-question}

\hypertarget{working-with-a-sample-space}{%

As a way to begin lets define terms that we will use for the next activities.

\item
  What is the definition of a sample space?
\item
  What is the definition of an event?
\item
  How are sample spaces, and event spaces related?
\end{itemize}

  \item
    How many elements exist in \(\Omega\)?
  \item
    What is an appropriate event space, and how many elements does it have?
  \item
    Give an example of an event.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\item
  \textbf{For a random sample of 1,000 Berkeley students}:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How would you define an appropriate sample space, \(\Omega\)?
  \item
    How big is \(\Omega\)? How many elements does it contain?
  \item
    What is an example of an event for this scenario?
  \item
    Can a single person be represented in the space twice? Why or why not?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5cm}

\hypertarget{independence}{%
\section{Independence}\label{independence}}

The book provides a (characteristically) terse statement of what it means for two events to be independent of one another.

\begin{definition}
\emph{Independence of Events} Events \(A, B \in S\) are \emph{independent} if \[P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)\].
\end{definition}

In your own words:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What does it mean for two events to be independent of one another?
\item
  How do you \textbf{know} if two events are independent of one another?
\item
  How do you \textbf{test} if two events are independent of one another?
\end{itemize}

Try using this idea of independent in two places:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose that you are creating a model to predict an outcome. Further, suppose that two events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent of one another. \emph{Can you use \(B\) to predict \(A\)}?
\item
  If two events, \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then what happens if you work through a statement of conditional probability, \(P(A|B)\)?
\end{enumerate}

You can submit these homework as many times as you like before the due date (you will not receive feedback), and you can access this homework through bCourses.

The \emph{applied} homework will be marked either \texttt{Correct} or \texttt{Incorrect} without partial credit applied. These are meant to be problems that you solve, and that have a single straightforward solution concept. The \emph{proof} homework will be marked for partial credit (out of three points) that evaluates your argument for your solution concept.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} that random variable are neither random, or variables, but instead that they are a foundational object that we can use to reason about a world.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} that the intuition developed by the use of set-theory probability maps into the more expressive space of random variables
\item
  \textbf{Apply} the appropriate mathematical transformations to move between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.
\end{enumerate}

From the axioms of probability, it is possible to build a whole, expressive modeling system (that need not be grounded \textbf{at all} in the minutia of the world). With this probability model in place, we can describe how frequently events in the random variable will occur. When variable are dependent upon each other, we can utilize information that is encoded in this dependence in order to make predictions that are \emph{closer to the truth} than predictions made without this information.

There is both a beauty and a tragedy when reasoning about random variables: we describe random variables using their joint density function.

The beauty is that by reasoning with such general objects we can produce guarantees that hold in every case, no matter the function that stands in for the joint density function.

The tragedy is that in the ``real world'', the world where we are going to eventually going to train and deploy our models, we are never provided with this joint density function. In examples that we compute, to provide a chance to reason about these objects, we will typically write down a \emph{specific} function that a random variable represents, despite the limitation that we cannot directly observe this function in the wild.

\hypertarget{study-groups}{%
\subsection{Study Groups}\label{study-groups}}

It is a \textbf{very} good idea for you to create a recurring time to work with a set of your classmates. Working together will help you solve questions more effectively, quickly, and will also help you to learn how to communicate what you do and do not understand about a problem to a group of collaborating data scientists. And, working together with a group will help you to find people who share data science interests with you.

\section{Using Definitions of Random Variables}\label{using-definitions-of-random-variables}}

\hypertarget{random-varaible}{%
\subsection{Random Varaible}\label{random-varaible}}

What is a random variable? Does this definition help you?

\begin{definition}[Random Variable]
A random variable is a function \(X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) such that \(\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \{\omega \in \Omega\}: X(\omega) \leq r\} \in S\).
\end{definition}

Someone, please, read that without using a single ``omega'', \(\mathbb{R}\), or other jargon terminology. Instead, someone read this aloud and tell us what each of the concepts mean.

The goal of writing with math symbols like this is to be \emph{absolutely} clear what concepts the author does and does not mean to invoke when they write a definition or a theorem. In a very real sense, this is a language that has specific meaning attached to specific symbols; there is a correspondence between the mathematical language and each of our home languages, but exactly what the relationship is needs to be defined into each student's home language.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What are the key things that random variables allow you to accomplish?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Suppose that you were going to try to make a model that predicts the probability of winning ``big money'' on the machine. Big money might be that you get :cherries: :cherries: :cherries:. Can you do \emph{math} with :cherries:?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Why do we say that random variables are functions? Is there some useful property of these being functions rather than any other quantity?

\hypertarget{functions-of-functions}{%
\subsection{Functions of Functions}\label{functions-of-functions}}

What about a function of a random variable, which is a function of a function.

\begin{definition}[Function of a Random Variable]
Let \(g : U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be some function, where \(X(\Omega) \subset U \subset \mathbb{R}\). Then, if \(g \circ X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is a random variable, we say that \(g\) is a \emph{function} of X and write \(g(X)\) to denote the random variable \(g \circ X\).
\end{definition}

If a random variable is a function from the real world, or the sample space, or the outcome space to a real number, then what does it mean to define a function of a random variable?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At what point does this function work? Does this function change the sample space that is possible to observe? Or, does this function change the real-number that each outcome points to?
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[MNIST]

Suppose that you are doing some image processing work. To keep things simple, that you are doing image classification in the style of the MNIST dataset.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can someone describe what this task is trying to accomplish?
\item
  Has anyone done work like this?
\end{itemize}

However, suppose that rather than having good clean indicators for whether a pixel is on or off, instead you have weak indicators -- there's a lot of grey. A lot of the cells are marked in the range \(0.2 - 0.3\).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How might creating a function that re-maps this grey into more extreme values help your model?
\item
  Is it possible to ``blur'' events that are in the outcome space? Does this ``blurring'' meet the requirements of a function of a random variable, as provided above?
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{pieces-of-a-random-variable}{%
\section{Pieces of a Random Variable}\label{pieces-of-a-random-variable}}

When you look at the definition of a random variable, there are two key pieces that must exist for every random variable. What are these pieces? As a hint, we actually developed one of these key pieces \emph{last} week when we were discussing elementary probability.

\begin{definition}[Random Variable, Suite]
A random variable is a function \(X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},\) such that \(\forall r \in \mathbb{R}, \{\omega \in \Omega\}: X(\omega) \leq r\} \in S\).
\end{definition}

\tightlist
\item
  What is a probability mass function?
\item
  What do the \textbf{Kolmogorov Axioms} mean must be true about any probability mass function (\emph{pmf})?
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Berkeley Drivers, No Survivors]

You should try driving in Berkeley some time. It is a \textbf{trip}! Without being deliberately ageist, the city is full of ageing hippies driving Subaru and making what seem to be stochastic right-or-left turns to buy incense, pottery, or just sourdough bread.

Suppose that you are walking to campus, and you have to cross 10 crosswalks, each of which are spaced a block apart. Further, suppose that as you get closer to campus, there are fewer aging hippies, and therefore, there is decreasing risk that you're hit by a Subaru as you cross the street. Specifically, and fortunately for our math, the risk of being hit decreases linearly with each block that you cross.

Finally, campus provides you with the safety reports from last year, and reports that there were 120 student-Subaru incidents last year, out of 10,000 student-crosswalk crossings.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the \emph{pmf} for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident as you walk across these 10 blocks? What sample space, \(\Omega\) is appropriate to represent this scenario?
\item
  Suppose that you don't leave your house -- this is a remote program after all! What is your cumulative probability of being involved in a student-subaru incident?\\
\item
  What is the cumulative probability \emph{cmf} for the probability that you are involved in a student-Subaru incident?
\item
  Suppose that you live three blocks from campus, but your classmate lives five blocks from campus. What is the difference in the cumulative probability?
\item
  How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk closer to campus? That is, suppose that you start 10 blocks away from campus, and are walking to get closer. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way to campus increasing or decreasing as you get closer to campus?
\item
  How would you describe the cumulative probability of being hit as you walk \textbf{further} from campus? That is, suppose that you start on campus, and you're walking to a bar after classes. Is your cumulative probability of being hit on your way away from campus increasing or decreasing as you get further from campus?
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{discrete-continuous-random-variables}{%
\section{Discrete \& Continuous Random Variables}\label{discrete-continuous-random-variables}}

What, if anything is fundamentally different between discrete and continuous random variables? As a way of starting the conversation, consider the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Suppose \(X\) is a random variable that describes the time a student spends on w203 homework 1.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you have only granular measurement -- i.e.~the number of nights spent working on the homework -- is this discrete or continuous?
  \item
    If you have the number of hours, is it discrete or continuous?
  \item
    If you have the number of seconds? Or milliseconds?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Is it possible that \(P(X = a) = 0\) for every point \(a\)? For example, that \(P(X = 3600) = 0\).
\item
  Does one of these measures have more \emph{information} in it than another?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    How are measurement choices that we make as designers of information capture systems -- i.e.~the machine processes, human processes, or other processes that we are going to work with as data scientists -- reflected in both the amount of information that is gathered, the type of information that is gathered, and the types of random variables that are manifest as a result?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}{%
\section{Moving Between PDF and CDF}\label{moving-between-pdf-and-cdf}}

The book defines \emph{pmf} and \emph{cmf} first as a way of developing intuition and a way of reasoning about these concepts. It then moves to defining continuous density functions, which is many ways are easier to work with although they lack the means of reasoning about them intuitively. Continuous distributions are defined in the book, and more generally, in terms of the \emph{cdf}, which is the cumulative density function. There are technical reasons for this choice of definition, some of which are signed in the footnotes on the page where the book presents it.

More importantly for this course, in \textbf{Definition 1.2.15} the book defines the relationship between \emph{cdf} and \emph{pdf} in the following way:

\begin{definition}[Probability Density Function (PDF)]
For a continous random variable \(X\) with CDF \(F\), the \emph{probability density function} of \(X\) is

\[
  f(x) = \left. \frac{d F(u)}{du} \right|_{u=x}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does this definition, which relates \emph{pdf} and \emph{cdf} by a means of differentiation and integration, fit with the ideas that we just developed in the context of walking to and from campus?
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}[Working with a continuous pdf and cdf]

Suppose that you learn than a particular random variable, \(X\) has the following function that describes its \emph{pdf}, \(f_{x}(x) = \frac{1}{10}x\). Also, suppose that you know that the smallest value that is possible for this random variable to obtain is 0.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the CDF of \(X\)?
\item
  What is the maximum possible value that \(x\) can obtain? How did you develop this answer, using the Kolmogorov axioms of probability?
\item
  What is the cumulative probability of an outcome up to 0.5?
\item
  What is the probability of an outcome between 0.25 and 0.75? Produce an answer to this in two ways:
\item
  Using the \(pdf\)
\item
  Using the \(cdf\)
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{joint-density}{%
\section{Joint Density}\label{joint-density}}

Working with a single random variable helps to develop our understanding of how to relate the different features of a \emph{pdf} and a \emph{cdf} through differentiation and integration. However, there's not really \emph{that} much else that we can do; and, there is probably very little in our professional worlds that would look like a single random variable in isolation.

We really start to get to something useful when we consider joint density functions. Joint density functions describe the probability that \emph{both} of two random variables. That is, if we are working with random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), then the joint density function provides a probability statement for \(P(X \cap Y)\).

In this course, we might typically write this joint density function as \(f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f(\cdot)\) where \(f(\cdot)\) is the actual function that represents the joint probability.

\hypertarget{uniform-joint-density}{%
\subsection{Uniform Joint Density}\label{uniform-joint-density}}

Suppose that we know that two variables, \(X\) and \(Y\) are jointly uniformly distributed within the the \emph{support} \(x \in [0,4], y \in [0,4]\). We have a requirement, imposed by the \emph{Kolmogorov Axioms} that all probabilities must be non-zero, and that the total probability across the whole support must be one.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Can you use these facts to determine answers to the following:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What kind of shape does this joint \emph{pdf} have?
  \item
    What is the specific function that describes this shape?
  \item
    If you draw this shape on three axes, and \(X\), and \(Y\), and a \(P(X,Y)\), what does this plot look like?
  \item
    How do you get from the joint density function, to a marginal density function for \(X\)?
  \item
    How do you get form the joint density function, to a marginal denisty function for \(Y\)?
  \item
    How do you get from these marginal density functions of \(X\) and \(Y\) back to the joint density? Is this alwasy possible?

  \item
    What is the conditional pdf of \(X\) given \(Y\)? That is, what is \$f\_\{x\textbar y\}(x,y)?
  \item

Here is the true density function for a normal random variable.

\includegraphics{203-live-session_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf}

\textbf{Simulate Draws}

There's another way to get an \textbf{approximate} idea of what the distribution looks like. Here's how we take a single draw from a normal distribution with a specific set of features:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1.00333
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Repeating the Experiment}

We want to rerun that experiment 10 times. We take a draw, then rewind time, clear our memory and start over with fresh randomness. To do this in R, an easy way is with the \texttt{replicate()} function. Change the code below so that it repeats the experiment above 10 times, then use \texttt{hist()} to display a plot of the result.

  What happens to your plot as you increase the number of draws from 10 to 100 to 1000\ldots?
\item
  In your own words, what is the difference between the distribution and the sample you are taking?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Visualization Trick}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is a pretty useful \emph{trick}.\\
\item
  The repetition we're using has no analogue in the real world -- we don't get to shake up the world like a snow globe a number of times in a row to see what it does.
\item
  But, when we say ``take a draw from the distribution'' another way to say this is that we're \emph{simulating} the random variable.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  Random variables are the building blocks of a model.
\item
  We can describe the distribution of a random variable using:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a cdf (all random varibles)
  \item
    a pmf (discrete random variables)
  \item
    a pdf (continuous random variables)

\item
  When we have multiple random variables,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a joint pmf / pdf describes how they behave together
  \item
    a marginal pmf / pdf describes one variable in isolation
  \item
    a conditonal pmf / pdf describes one variable given the value of another
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Roadmap -- Today's Lesson}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A joint distribution has more information than we can ever use (or estimate with finite data).

    Expectation
  \item
    Variance
  \item
    Covariance

\chapter{Conditional Expectation and The BLP}\label{conditional-expectation-and-the-blp}}

One of our most fundamental goals as data scientists is to produce predictions that are \emph{good}. In this week's async, we make a statement of performance that we can use to evaluate how good a job a predictor is doing, choosing Mean Squared Error.

With the goal of minimizing MSE, then we then present, justify, and prove that the conditional expectation function (\emph{the CEF}) is the globally best possible predictor. This is an incredible powerful result, and one that serves as the backstop for \textbf{every} other predictor that you will ever fit, whether that predictor is a ``simple'' regression, or that predictor is a machine learning algorithms (e.g.~a random forest) or a deep learning algorithm. Read that again -- even the most technologically advanced algorithms \emph{cannot possibly} perform better than the conditional expectation function.

Why does the CEF do so well? Because it can contain a \emph{vast} amount of complex information and relationships; in fact, the complexity of the CEF is a product of the complexity of the underlying probability space. If that is the case, then why don't we just use the CEF as our predictor every time?

Well, this is one of the core problems of applied data science work: we are never given the function that describes the behavior of the random variable. And so, we're left in a world where we are forced to produce predictions from simplifications of the CEF. A very strong simplification, but one that is useful for our puny human brains, is to restrict ourselves to predictors that make predictions from a linear combination of input variables.

Why should we make such a strong restriction? After all, the conditional expectation function might be a fantastically complex combination of input features, why should we entertain functions that are only linear combinations? Essentially, this is because we're limited in our ability to reason about anything more complex than a linear combination.

  \item
    We need to find such function \(g: R \to R\) that gives the smallest \(E[(Y-g(X))^2]\).

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \(E[V[Y|X]]\) doesn't depend on \(g\); and,
\item
  \(E[(E[Y|X]-g(X))^2]\ge 0\).
\end{itemize}

\(\therefore g(X) = E[Y|X]\) gives the smallest \(E[(Y-g(X))^2]\)

\begin{itemize}

\section{Working with the BLP}\label{working-with-the-blp}}

Why Linear?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In some cases, we might try to estimate the CEF. More commonly, however, we work with linear predictors. Why?
\item
  We don't know joint density function of \(Y\). So, it is ``difficult'' to derive a suitable CEF.
\item
  To estimate \emph{flexible} functions requires considerably more data. Assumptions about distribution (e.g.~a linear form) allow you to leverage those assumptions to learn `more' from the same amount of data.
\item
  Other times, the CEF, even if we \emph{could} produce an estimate, might be so complex that it isn't useful or would be difficult to work with.
\item
  And, many times, linear predictors (which might seem trivially simple) actually do a very good job of producing predictions that are `close' or useful.

\textbf{Part 1}

Throughout this part, we will use fair coins (\texttt{p\ =\ 0.5}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fill in the function below so that it simulates taking n draws from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p.~This is like tossing n coins at the same time. Use the \texttt{mean} function to compute the sample mean -- the average of the number of heads that are showing. Make sure that when you run it, you return values in \(\{0,1/3,2/3,1\}\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  The sample mean is a random variable. To understand it, use the visualization trick from a few weeks ago. Use the \texttt{replicate} function to run the above experiment 1000 times, and plot a histogram of the results.
\item
  If you replicate the experiment enough times, will the distribution ever look normal? Why or why not?
\item
  Use \texttt{sd()} to check the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean for \texttt{number\_of\_coins\ =\ 3}. What sample size is needed to decrease the standard deviation by a factor of 10? Check that your answer is correct.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 2}

For this part, we'll continue to study a fair coin.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  Try different values for the sample size n, and examine the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean. At what point does it look normal to you?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Part 3}

For this part, we'll study a very unfair coin. \texttt{p\ =\ 0.01}.

This is an example of a highly skewed random variable. That roughly means that one tail is a lot longer than the other.

For this activity, you can simply use your eyes to gauge how skewed a distribution is. If you prefer, you can also use the skewness command in the univar package to measure skewness. You may hear a rule of thumb that a skewness above 1 or below -1 is a highly skewed distribution.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\item
  Start with n=3 as before. What do you notice about the shape of the sampling distribution?
\item
  Try different values for the sample size n, and examine the shape of the sampling distribution of the mean. At what point does it look normal to you?
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{discussion-questions}{%
\subsection{Discussion Questions}\label{discussion-questions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How does the skewness of the population distribution affect the applicability of the Central Limit Theorem? What lesson can you take for your practice of statistics?
\item
  Name a variable you would be interested in measuring that has a substantially skewed distribution.
\item
  One definition of a heavy tailed distribution is one with infinite variance. For example, you can use the \texttt{rcauchy} command in R to take draws from a Cauchy distribution, which has heavy tails. Do you think a ``heavy tails'' distribution will follow the CLT? What leads you to this intuition?

\hypertarget{hypothesis-testing}{%
\chapter{Hypothesis Testing}\label{hypothesis-testing}}

Frequentist Hypothesis testing is a very well established framework in the applied practice, and scientific literature. Sometimes (often, currently) referred to as Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, this framework essentially makes an absurd assumption and asks the data to overturn that absurt assumption.

Like a petulant child, NHST essentially proclaims,

\begin{quote}
``Oh yeah? Well, if you actually loved me then you would buy me an iPad!''
\end{quote}

Which is to say, it says, ``Oh yeah? If this absurd thing isn't true, prove it to me!''

\subsection*{What is Frequentist testing doing?}\label{what-is-frequentist-testing-doing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{What is Frequentist testing doing?}

This testing framework works on \textbf{samples} of data, and applies \textbf{estimators} to produce \textbf{estimates} of \textbf{population parameters} that are fundamentally unknown and unknowable. Despite this unknown and unknowable population target, with some carefully written down estimators we can rely on the convergence characteristics of some estimators to produce \emph{useful}, \emph{reliable} results.

We begin with the one-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test relies on the sample average as an estimator of a population expectation. In doing so, it relies on the effectiveness of the \textbf{Weak Law of Large Numbers} and the \textbf{Central Limit Theorem} to guarantee that the estimator that \textbf{converges in probability} to the population expectation, while also \textbf{converging in distribution} to a Gaussian distribution.

These two convergences permit a data scientist to make several \textbf{inferences} based on data:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The probability of generating data that \emph{``looks like what is observed''}, if the null-hypothesis were true. This is often referred to as the \textbf{p-value} of a test, and is the petulant statement identified above.
\item
  An interval of values that, with some stated probability (e.g.~95\%), contains the true population parameter.
\end{enumerate}

This framework begins a \textbf{exceedingly important} task that we must understand, and undertake when we are working as data scientists: Producing our best-estimate, communicating how we arrived at that estimate, what (if any) guarantees that estimate provides, and \emph{crucially} all \textbf{limitations} of our estimate.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Like the first test, our goal is to communicate to you what concepts we think are important, and then to test those concepts directly, and fairly. The purpose of the test is to give you an incentive to review what you have learned through probability theory, and then to demonstrate that you can produce work based on that knowledge.

\textbf{Looking Backwards}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statisticians create a model to represent the world
\item
  We saw examples of estimators, which approximate model parameters we're interested in.
\item
  By itself, an estimate isn't much good; we need to capture the uncertainty in the estimate.
\item
  We've seen two ways to express uncertainty in an estimator: standard errors and confidence intervals.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Today}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We introduce hypothesis testing

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A hypothesis test also captures uncertainty, but in relation to a specific hypothesis.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We'll build on the one-sample t-test, to introduce several other statistical tests.
\item
  We'll see how to choose a test from different alternatives, with an eye on meeting the required assumptions, and maximizing power.

\item
  What are the two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test?
\item
  What are the four-possible combinations of (a) hypothesis test rest; and (b) state of the world?
\item
  Does a hypothesis test always have to report a result that is consistent with the state of the world? What does it mean if it \emph{does}, and what does it mean if it \emph{does not}.
\item
  What if you made up your own testing framework, called the \{Your Last Name's\} Groundhog test. Which is literally a groundhog looking to see its shadow. Because you made the test, suppose that you know that it is \emph{totally random} whether a groundhog sees its shadow. \emph{How useful would this test be at separating states of the world?}\\
\item
  What guarantee do you get if you follow the decision rules properly?
\item
  Why do we standardize the mean to create a test statistic?

You're skeptical, but also curious because that last test was tough. Good.

This week, we introduce the idea of comparing two groups to evaluate whether the data that we have sampled lead us to believe that the population distribution of the random variables are different. Of course, because we don't get access to the function that describes the random variable, we can't \emph{actually} know if the populations are different. It is for this reason that we call it statistical inference -- we are inferring from a sample some belief about the populations.

\subsection{Working on Data Science Teams}\label{working-on-data-science-teams}}

Data science is a \emph{beautiful} combination of team-work and individual-work. It provides the opportunity to work together on a data pipeline with people from all over the organization, to deal with technical, statistical, and social questions that are always interesting. While we expect that everyone on a team will be a professional, there is so much range within the pursuit of data science that projects are nearly always collaborative exercises.

Together as teams, we

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Define research ambitions and scope
\item
  Imagine/envision the landscape of what is possible
\item
  Support, discuss, review and integrate individual contributions
\end{itemize}

Together as individuals we conduct the heads-down work that moves question answering forward. This might be reading papers to determine the most appropriate method to bring to bear on the question, or researching the data that is available, or understanding the technical requirements that we have to meet for this answer to be useful to our organization in real time.

What is your instructor \emph{uniquely} capable of? Let them tell you! But, at the same time, what would they acknowledge that others are better than them?

See, the thing is, because there is so much that has to be done, there literally are very, very few people who are one-stop data science shops. Instead, teams rely on collaboration and joint expertise in order to get good work done.

\hypertarget{the-problematic-psychology-of-data-science}{%
\subsection{The Problematic Psychology of Data Science}\label{the-problematic-psychology-of-data-science}}

People talk about the \emph{impostor syndrome}: a feeling of inadequacy or interloping that is sometimes also associated with a fear of under-performing relative to the expectation of others on the team. These emotions are common through data science, academics, computer science. But, these types of emotions are also commonplace in journalism, film-making, and public speaking.

Has anybody ever had the dream that they're late to a test? Or, that that they've got to give a speech that they're unprepared for? Does anybody remember playing an instrument as a kid and having to go to recitals? Or, play for a championship on a youth sports team? Or, go into a test two?

What are the feelings associated with those events? What might be generating these feelings?

\section{Regression Plots and Discussion}\label{regression-plots-and-discussion}}

In this next set of notes, we're going to give some data, displayed in plots, and we will try to apply what we have learned in the async and reading for this week to answer questions about each of the scatter plots.

\hypertarget{plot-1}{%
\subsection{Plot 1}\label{plot-1}}

Consider data that is generated according to the following function:

\[
  Y = 1 + 2x_1 + 3x_2 + e, 
\]

where \(x_1 \sim N(0,2)\), \(x_2 \sim N(0,2)\) and \(e\) is a constant equal to zero.

From this population, you might consider taking a sample of 100 observations, and representing this data in the following 3d scatter plot. In this plot, there are three dimensions, an \(x_1, x_2\), and \(y\) dimensions.

\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Rotate the cube and explore the data, looking at each face of the cube, including from the top down.
\item
  One of the lessons that we learned during the random variables section of the course is that every random variable that has been measured can also be marginalized off. You might think of this as ``casting down'' data from three dimensions, to only two.
\item
  Sketch the following 2d scatter plots, taking care the label your axes. You need not represent all 100 points, but rather create the \emph{gestalt} of what you see.\\
  1. \(Y = f(x_1)\) (but not \(x_2\))
  2. \(Y = f(x_2)\) (but not \(x_1\))
  3. \(x2 = f(x_1)\)
\item
  Once you have sketched the scatter plots, what line would you fit that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in the vertical direction. Define a residual, \(\epsilon\), to be the vertical distance between the line you draw, and the corresponding point on the input data.
\item
  What is the \emph{average} of the residuals for each of the lines that you have fitted? How does this correspond to the \emph{moment conditions} discussed in the async? What would happen if you translated this line vertically?
\item
  Rotate the cube so that the points ``fall into line''. When you see this line, how does it help you describe the function that governs this data?

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  Sometimes, the model includes an ``outcome'' random variable \(Y\) and ``input'' random variables \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\).
\item
  The joint distribution of \(Y\) and \(X_1, X_2,...,X_k\) is complicated.
\item
  The best linear predictor (BLP) is the canonical way to summarize the relationship.

\subsection{Understanding Uncertainty}\label{understanding-uncertainty}}

Under the relatively stricter assumptions of constant error variance, the variance of a slope coefficient is given by

\[
  V(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_j (1-R_j^2)}
\]

A similar formulation is given in \emph{FOAS} as definition 4.2.3,

\[
  \hat{V}_{C}[\hat{\beta}] = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left( X^{T} X \right)^{-1} \rightsquigarrow \frac{\hat{\sigma}^{2}}{\left( X^{T}X\right)}
\]

Explain why each term makes the variance higher or lower:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\sigma^2\) is the variance of the error \(\epsilon\)
\item
  \(SST_j\) is (unscaled) variance of \(X_j\)
\item
  \(R_j^2\) is \(R^2\) for a regression of \(X_j\) on the other \(X\)'s

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Estimate a new model (and save it into another object) that includes the size of the lot and whether the house is a colonial. This will estimate the model:
\end{enumerate}

\[ 
  price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial? + e
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{BUT BEFORE YOU DO}, make a prediction: What do you think is going to happen to the coefficient that relates square footage and price?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Will the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Will the \emph{uncertainty} about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same?
  \item
    Conduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model \emph{as a whole} does better when the coefficients on \texttt{colonial} and \texttt{lotsize} are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e.~\(\beta_{2} = \beta_{3} = 0\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  Use the function \texttt{vcovHC} from the \texttt{sandwich} package to estimate (a) the the heteroskedastic consistent (i.e.~``robust'') variance covariance matrix; and (b) the robust standard errors for the intercept and slope of this regression. Recall, what is the relationship between the VCOV and SE in a regression?
\item
  Perform a hypothesis test to check whether the population relationship between \texttt{sqrft} and \texttt{price} is zero. Use \texttt{coeftest()} with the robust standard errors computed above.
\item
  Use the robust standard error and \texttt{qt} to compute a 95\% confidence interval for the coefficient \texttt{sqrft} in the second model that you estimated. \(price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial\).
\item
  \textbf{Bootstrap.} The book \emph{very} quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling \emph{with replacement} and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have.
\end{enumerate}

Below is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the \texttt{sqrft} variable when \texttt{lotsize} and \texttt{colonial} are included in the model.

The file \texttt{htv.RData} contains data from the 1991 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, provided by Wooldridge. All people in the sample are males age 26 to 34. The data is interesting here, because it includes education, stored in the variable \texttt{educ}, and also a score on an ability test, stored in the variable \texttt{abil}.

Assume that the true model is,

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/wage_system.png}

\textbf{Questions:}

1- Are we able to \emph{directly} measure ability? If so, how would you propose to measure it?

2- If not, what \emph{do} we measure and how is this measurement related to ability? And there is a lot of evidence to suggest that standardized tests are not a very good proxy. But for now, let's pretend that we really are measuring ability.

3- Using R, estimate (a) the true model, and (b) the regression of ability on education.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Write down the expression for what omitted variable bias would be if you couldn't measure ability.
\item
  Add this omitted variable bias to the coefficient for education to see what it would be.
\end{itemize}

4- Now evaluate your previous result by fitting the model, \[wage = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 educ + w\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the coefficient for the relationship between education and wages match what you estimated earlier?
\item
  Why or why not?
\end{itemize}

5- Reflect on your results:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  What does the direction of omitted variable bias suggest about OLS estimates of returns to education?
\item
  What does this suggest about the reported statistical significance of education?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
\item
  The BLP is a useful summary for a relationship among random variables.
\item
  OLS regression is an estimator for the Best Linear Predictor (BLP).
\item
  For a large sample, we only need two mild assumptions to work with OLS

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To know coefficients are consistent
  \item
    To have valid standard errors, hypothesis tests

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Today}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Classical Linear Model (CLM) allows us to apply regression to smaller samples.
\item
  The CLM requires more to be true of the data generating process, to make coefficients, standard errors, and tests \emph{meaningful} in small samples.
\item
  Understanding if the data meets these requirements (often called assumptions) requires considerable care.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Looking Ahead}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The CLM -- and the methods that we use to evaluate the CLM -- are the basis of advanced models (\emph{inter alia} time-series)
\item
  (Week 13) In a regression studies (and other studies), false discovery is a widespread problem. Understanding its causes can make you a better member of the scientific community.

\textbf{Status Update}
You have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You run 7 different t-tests, one for posts on Monday (versus all other days), or for Tuesday (versus all other days), etc. Only the test for Sunday is significant, with a p-value of .045, so you throw out the other tests.

Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts? (How can you address this situation responsibly when you publish your results?)

\textbf{Such Update}
As before, you have a dataset of the number of Facebook status updates by day of the week. You do a little EDA and notice that Sunday seems to have more ``status updates'' than all other days, so you recode your ``day of the week'' variable into a binary one: Sunday = 1, All other days = 0. You run a t-test and get a p-value of .045. Should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Funday}
Suppose researcher A tests if Monday has an effect (versus all other days), Researcher B tests Tuesday (versus all other days), and so forth. Only Researcher G, who tests Sunday finds a significant effect with a p-value of .045. Only Researcher G gets to publish her work. If you read the paper, should you conclude that Sunday has a significant effect on number of posts?

\textbf{Sunday Repentence}
What if researcher G above is a sociologist that chooses to measure the effect of Sunday based on years of observing the way people behave on weekends? Researcher G is not interested in the other tests, because Sunday is the interesting day from her perspective, and she wouldn't expect any of the other tests to be significant.

\textbf{Decreasing Effect Sizes}
Many observers have noted that as studies yielding statistically significant results are repeated, estimated effect sizes go down and often become insignificant. Why is this the case?

  Suppose that a firm's profit from selling a product is related to price, \(p\), and cost, \(c\), as follows:
\end{itemize}

\[ 
\text{profit} = (p - p^2) - c + 100
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Explain how you would use calculus to find the maximizing price. Assume that cost is fixed.
\item
  What is the firms revenue as \texttt{p=0,\ cost\ =\ 2}? What is it at \texttt{p=10,\ cost\ =\ 2}?
\item
  Create a plot with the following characteristics:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    On the x-axis is a sequence (\texttt{seq()}) of prices from {[}0, 10{]}.
  \item
    On the y-axis is the revenue as a function of those prices. Hold cost constant at \texttt{c=2}.\\
  \item
    What does the best price seem to be?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Solve this numerically in \emph{R}, using the \emph{optimize()} function.

\section{Confidence Intervals}\label{confidence-intervals}}

This exercise is meant to demonstrate what the confidence level in a confidence interval represents. We will assume a standard normal population distribution and simulate what happens when we draw a sample and compute a confidence interval.

Your task is to complete the following function so that it,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  simulates and stores\texttt{}n draws from a standard normal distribution
\item
  based on those draws, computes a valid confidence interval with confidence level \(\alpha\), a parameter that you pass to the function.
\end{enumerate}

Your function should return a vector of length 2, containing the lower bound and upper bound of the confidence interval.

\[
CI_{\alpha} = \overline{X} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(CI_\alpha\) is the confidence interval that you're seeking to produce
\item
  \(\overline{X}\) is the sample average,\\
\item
  \(t_{\alpha/2}\) is your critical value (accessible through \texttt{qt}),
\item
  and \(s\) is your sample standard deviation. Notice that you'll need each of these pieces in the code that you're about to write.

\textbf{Part II}

The data resembles draws from a Bernoulli distribution.

However, even if we want to model this as a Bernoulli distribution, we do not know the value of the parameter, \(p\).

1- Define your random variable.

2- Write down the likelihood function

3- If it will make the math easier, log the likelihood function.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Bloom's Taxonomy}

An effective rubric for student understanding is attributed to Bloom (1956). Referred to as \emph{Bloom's Taxonomy}, this proposes that there is a hierarchy of student understanding; that a student may have one \emph{level} of reasoning skill with a concept, but not another. The taxonomy proposes to be ordered: some levels of reasoning build upon other levels of reasoning.

In the learning objective that we present in for each live session, we will also identify the level of reasoning that we hope students will achieve at the conclusion of the live session.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remember} A student can remember that the concept exists. This might require the student to define, duplicate, or memorize a set of concepts or facts.
\item
  \textbf{Understand} A student can understand the concept, and can produce a working technical and non-technical statement of the concept. The student can explain why the concept \emph{is}, or why the concept works in the way that it does.
\item
  \textbf{Apply} A student can use the concept as it is intended to be used against a novel problem.
\item
  \textbf{Analyze} A student can assess whether the concept has worked as it should have. This requires both an understanding of the intended goal, an application against a novel problem, and then the ability to introspect or reflect on whether the result is as it should be.
\item
  \textbf{Evaluate} A student can analyze multiple approaches, and from this analysis evaluate whether one or another approach has better succeeded at achieving its goals.
\item
  \textbf{Create} A student can create a new or novel method from axioms or experience, and can evaluate the performance of this new method against existing approaches or methods.
