Let's make a simple predictor: 

- I've got some chickens at home, how many eggs will I get? 

```{r}
eggproduction  <- 
  readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-04-11/egg-production.csv')
cagefreepercentages <-
  readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-04-11/cage-free-percentages.csv')
```

## Setup Code

What is the average number of eggs per chicken? 

```{r}

```

If I have two chickens, how many eggs do I think I'll produce? 

```{r}

```

## Differences in Type 

What if I have some chickens that are free range, some that are organic *and* free range, and still others that are confinement raised? 

Now we need a model! 

```{r}

```
