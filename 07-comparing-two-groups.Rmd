# Comparing Two Groups

![](./images/goin_left.jpeg)

## Learning Objectives 

This week, we introduce the idea of comparing two groups to evaluate whether the data that we have sampled lead us to believe that the population distribution of the random variables are different. Of course, because we don't get access to the function that describes the random variable, we can't *actually* know if the populations are different. It is for this reason that we call it statistical inference -- we are inferring from a sample some belief about the populations. 

At the conclusion of this week, students will be able to:

1. *Recognize* the similarities between all frequentist hypothesis tests. 
2. *Evaluate* the conditions that surround the data, and choose a test that is best-powered and justifiable.
3. *Perform* and *Interpret* the results of the most common statistical tests.

## Class Announcements

- Great work completing your final w203 test!
- There is **no** unit 7 homework! 
- The Hypothesis Testing Lab is released today! 
    - Lab is due at Unit 09 Live Session (two weeks)
    - Group lab in two parts: 
      - *Part 1*: Work as a team to engage the fundamentals of hypothesis tests
      - *Part 2*: Apply these fundamentals to analyze 2020 election data and write a single, three-page analysis
    

## Roadmap
### Rearview Mirror

- Statisticians create a population model to represent the world
- A population model has parameters we are interested in
    - Ex: A parameter might represent the effect that a vitamin has on test performance
- A null hypothesis is a specific statement about a parameter
    - Ex: The vitamin has zero effect on performance
- A hypothesis test is a procedure for rejecting or not rejecting a null, such the probability of a type 1 error is constrained.

### Today

- There are often multiple hypothesis tests you can apply to a scenario.
- Our primary concern is choosing a test with assumptions we can defend.
- Secondarily, we want to maximize power.

### Looking ahead 

- Next week, we start working with models for linear regression
- We will see how hypothesis testing is also used for regression parameters.

## Teamwork Discussion
### Working on Data Science Teams

Data science is a *beautiful* combination of team-work and individual-work. It provides the opportunity to work together on a data pipeline with people from all over the organization, to deal with technical, statistical, and social questions that are always interesting. While we expect that everyone on a team will be a professional, there is so much range within the pursuit of data science that projects are nearly always collaborative exercises. 

Together as teams, we

  - Define research ambitions and scope
  - Imagine/envision the landscape of what is possible 
  - Support, discuss, review and integrate individual contributions
  
Together as individuals we conduct the heads-down work that moves question answering forward. This might be reading papers to determine the most appropriate method to bring to bear on the question, or researching the data that is available, or understanding the technical requirements that we have to meet for this answer to be useful to our organization in real time. 

What is your instructor *uniquely* capable of? Let them tell you! But, at the same time, what would they acknowledge that others are better than them? 

See, the thing is, because there is so much that has to be done, there literally are very, very few people who are one-stop data science shops. Instead, teams rely on collaboration and joint expertise in order to get good work done. 

### The Problematic Psychology of Data Science

People talk about the *impostor syndrome*: a feeling of inadequacy or interloping that is sometimes also associated with a fear of under-performing relative to the expectation of others on the team. These emotions are common through data science, academics, computer science. But, these types of emotions are also commonplace in journalism, film-making, and public speaking. 

Has anybody ever had the dream that they're late to a test? Or, that that they've got to give a speech that they're unprepared for? Does anybody remember playing an instrument as a kid and having to go to recitals? Or, play for a championship on a youth sports team? Or, go into a test two? 

What are the feelings associated with those events? What might be generating these feelings?

### What Makes an Effective Team?

- This reading on [*effective* teams](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/) summarizes academic research to argue: 

> What really matters to creating an effective tema is less about who is on the team, and more about how the team works together. 

In your live session, your section might take 7 minutes to read this brief. If so, please read the following sections: 

- The problem statement; 
- The proposed solution; 
- The framework for team effectiveness, stopping at the section titled *"Tool: Help teams determine their own needs."* 

> "Psychological safety refers to an individual's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk. It is a belief that a team is safe for risk taking in the face of being seen as ignorant, incompetent, negative, or disruptive." 
> 
> "In a team with high psychological safety, teammates feel safe to take risks around their team members. They feel confident that no one on the team will embarrass or punish anyone else for admitting a mistake, asking a question, or offering a new idea."

### We All Belong

- From your experience, can you give an example of taking a personal risk as part of a team?
    - Can you describe your emotions when contemplating this risk?
    - If you did take the risk, how did the reactions of your teammates affect you?
  
- Knowing the circumstances that generate feelings of anxiety -- what steps can we take as a section, or a team, to recognize and respond to these circumstances? 

> How can you add to the psychological safety of your peers in the section and lab teammates?

## Team Kick-Off
**Lab 1 Teams**

- Here are teams for Lab 1! 

**Team Kick-Off Conversation**

- In a 10 minute breakout with your team, please discuss the following questions: 

1. How much time will you invest in the lab each week?
2. How often will you meet and for how long?
3. How will you discuss, review, and integrate individual work into the team deliverable?
4. What do you see as the biggest risks when working on a team?  How can you contribute to an effective team dynamic?

## A Quick Review
**Review of Key Terms**

- Define each of the following:
    - Population Parameter
    - Null Hypothesis
    - Test Statistic
    - Null Distribution

**Comparing Groups Review**

Take a moment to recall the tests you learned this week.  Here is a quick cheat-sheet to their key assumptions.

| paired/unpaired | parametric                                                                      | non-parametric                                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| unpaired        | **unpaired t-test** <br> - metric var <br> - i.i.d. <br> - (not too un-)normal  | **Wilcoxon rank-sum** <br> ordinal var <br> i.i.d. <br>  |
| paired          | **paired t-test** <br> metric var <br> i.i.d. <br> (not too un-)normal          | **Wilcoxon signed-rank** <br> metric var <br> i.i.d. <br> difference is symmetric  <br> <br> **sign test** <br> ordinal var <br> i.i.d. |
   
## Comparing Groups R Exercise

The General Social Survey (GSS) is one of the longest running and extensive survey projects in the US.  The full dataset includes over 1000 variables spanning demographics, attitudes, and behaviors.  The file `GSS_w203.RData` contains a small selection of a variables from the 2018 GSS.  

To learn about each variable, you can enter it into the search bar at the [GSS data explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/vfilter)
    
```{r}
load('data/GSS_w203.RData')
summary(GSS)
```

You have a set of questions that you would like to answer with a statistical test. **For each question**:

1. Choose the most appropriate test.
2. List and evaluate the assumptions for your test.
3. Conduct your test.
4. Discuss statistical and practical significance.

## The Questions 

### Set 1 
- Do economics majors watch more or less TV than computer science majors?
- Do Americans with pets watch more or less TV than Americans without pets?

### Set 2
- Do Americans spend more time emailing or using the web?
- Do Americans spend more evenings with neighbors or with relatives?

### Set 3
