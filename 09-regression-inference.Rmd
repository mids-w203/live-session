2. Homework 09 has been assigned today, and it's due in a week.

## Roadmap

**Rear-View Mirror**

- Statisticians create a population model to represent the world.
- Sometimes, the model includes an "outcome" random variable $Y$ and "input" random variables $X_1, X_2,...,X_k$.
- The joint distribution of $Y$ and $X_1, X_2,...,X_k$ is complicated.
- The best linear predictor (BLP) is the canonical way to summarize the relationship.
- OLS provides a point estimate of the BLP

**Today**

- Robust Standard Error: quantify the uncertainty of OLS coefficients
- Hypothesis testing with OLS coefficients
- Bootstrapping

**Looking Ahead**

- Regression is a foundational tool that can be applied to different contexts
- The process of building a regression model looks different, depending on whether the goal is prediction, description, or explanation.

## Uncertainty in OLS
### Discussion Questions

- List as many differences between the BLP and the OLS line as you can.
- In the following regression table, explain in your own words what the standard error in parentheses means.

|               | outcome: sleep hours |
|---------------|----------------------|
| mg. melatonin |    0.52              |
|               |   (0.31)             |
   
## Understanding Uncertainty

Imagine three different regression models, each of the following form:

$$
  Y = 0 + 0 \cdot X + \epsilon
$$

The only difference is in the error term. The conditional distribution is given by:

Model | Distribution of $\epsilon$ cond. on $X$
------|----------------------------------------
 A    | Uniform on $[-.5, +.5]$
 B    | Uniform on $[ - |X|, |X| ]$
 C    | Uniform on $[ -1 + |X|, 1- |X| ]$
 
A is what we call a homoskedastic distribution. B and C are what we call heteroskedastic. Below, we define R functions that simulate draws from these three distributions.
 
```{r}
rA <- function(n, slope=0){
  x       = runif(n, min=-1, max = 1)
  epsilon = runif(n, min=-.5, max=.5)
  y       = 0 + slope*x + epsilon
  return( data.frame(x=x,y=y) )
}

rB <- function(n, slope=0){
  x       = runif(n, min=-1, max = 1)
  epsilon = runif(n, min=- abs(x), max=abs(x))
  y       = 0 + slope*x + epsilon
  return( data.frame(x=x,y=y) )
}

rC <- function(n, slope=0){
  x       = runif(n, min=-1, max = 1)
  epsilon = runif(n, min= -1 + abs(x), max=1 - abs(x))
  y       = 0 + slope*x + epsilon
  return( data.frame(x=x,y=y) )
}
```

```{r}
data <- rbind( 
  data.frame( rA(200), label = 'A'),
  data.frame( rB(200), label = 'B'),
  data.frame( rC(200), label = 'C'))
```

```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  lims(
    x = c(-2,2), 
    y = c(-1,1)) + 
  labs(title = 'Samples Drawn from Three Distributions') + 
  facet_grid(rows=vars(label))
```

### Question 1

The following code draws a sample from distribution A, fits a regression line, and plots it. Run it a few times to see what happens. Now explain how you would visually estimate the standard error of the slope coefficient. Why is this standard error important?

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=3, dpi=300}
data <-  rA(10, slope=0)

data %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=x, y=y) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = 'y ~ x', se=FALSE) + 
  lims(
    x = c(-2,2), 
    y = c(-1,1)) + 
  labs(title = 'Regression Fit to Distribution A')
```

```{r}
base_plot_a <- rA(10) %>%  
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=x, y=y) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE, formula = 'y ~x')

for(i in 1:100) { 
    base_plot_a <- base_plot_a + rA(100) %>% 
      stat_smooth(mapping = aes(x=x, y=y), method='lm', se=FALSE, formula='y~x', color = 'grey', size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
}

base_plot_b <- rB(10) %>%  
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=x, y=y) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE, formula = 'y ~x')

for(i in 1:100) { 
    base_plot_b <- base_plot_b + rB(100) %>% 
      stat_smooth(mapping = aes(x=x, y=y), method='lm', se=FALSE, formula='y~x', color = 'grey', size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
  }

base_plot_c <- rC(10) %>%  
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=x, y=y) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE, formula = 'y ~x')

for(i in 1:100) { 
    base_plot_c <- base_plot_c + rC(100) %>% 
      stat_smooth(mapping = aes(x=x, y=y), method='lm', se=FALSE, formula='y~x', color = 'grey', size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5)
}



base_plot_a | base_plot_b  | base_plot_c
```


### Question 2 
You have a sample from each distribution, A, B, and C and you fit a regression of Y on X. Which will have the highest standard error for the slope coefficient? Which will have the lowest standard error? Why? (You may want to try experimenting with the function defined above)

### Question 3 
For distribution A, perform a simulated experiment. Draw a large number of samples, and for each sample fit a linear regression. Store the slope coefficient from each regression in a vector. Finally, compute the standard deviation for the slope coefficients.

Repeat this process for distributions B and C. Do the results match your intuition?
   
   

## Understanding Uncertainty

Under the relatively stricter assumptions of constant error variance, the variance of a slope coefficient is given by

$$
  V(\hat{\beta_j}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{SST_j (1-R_j^2)}
$$

A similar formulation is given in *FOAS* as definition 4.2.3, 

$$
  \hat{V}_{C}[\hat{\beta}] = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left( X^{T} X \right)^{-1} \rightsquigarrow \frac{\hat{\sigma}^{2}}{\left( X^{T}X\right)}
$$

Explain why each term makes the variance higher or lower:

- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the error $\epsilon$
- $SST_j$ is (unscaled) variance of $X_j$
- $R_j^2$ is $R^2$ for a regression of $X_j$ on the other $X$'s

## R Exercise
**Real Estate in Boston** 

The file `hprice1.RData` contains 88 observations of homes in the Boston area, taken from the real estate pages of the Boston Globe during 1990.  This data was provided by Wooldridge.

```{r}
load('data/hprice1.RData') # provides 3 objects 
```

Last week, we fit a regression of price on square feet. 

```{r}
model_one <- lm(price ~ sqrft, data = data)
model_one

## any frequentist test has what components: numerator and denominator? 

numerator   <- 0.14
denominator <- diag(sqrt(vcovHC(model_one)))['sqrft']

test_stat <- numerator / denominator

test_stat

pt(test_stat, df = 87, lower.tail = FALSE) * 2
```

```{r}
## we could do it by hand... or... let someone else do it for us

coeftest(model_one, vcov. = vcovHC(model_one))
```





```{r}
var(data['sqrft']) 
```


**Questions**

1. Estimate a new model (and save it into another object) that includes the size of the lot and whether the house is a colonial. This will estimate the model: 

$$
  price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial? + e
$$ 

- *BUT BEFORE YOU DO*, make a prediction: What do you think is going to happen to the coefficient that relates square footage and price? 
  - Will the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same? 
  - Will the *uncertainty* about the coefficient increase, decrease, or stay the same? 
  - Conduct an F-test that evaluates whether the model *as a whole* does better when the coefficients on `colonial` and `lotsize` are allowed to estimate freely, or instead are restricted to be zero (i.e. $\beta_{2} = \beta_{3} = 0$. 


2. Use the function `vcovHC` from the `sandwich` package to estimate (a) the the heteroskedastic consistent (i.e. "robust") variance covariance matrix; and (b) the robust standard errors for the intercept and slope of this regression. Recall, what is the relationship between the VCOV and SE in a regression? 

```{r}

```

3. Perform a hypothesis test to check whether the population relationship between `sqrft` and `price` is zero. Use `coeftest()` with the robust standard errors computed above. 

```{r}

```

4. Use the robust standard error and `qt` to compute a 95% confidence interval for the coefficient `sqrft` in the second model that you estimated. $price = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} sqrft + \beta_{2} lotsize + \beta_{3} colonial$. 

5. **Bootstrap.** The book *very* quickly talks about bootstrapping which is the process of sampling *with replacement* and fitting a model. The idea behind the bootstrap is that since the data is generated via an iid sample from the population, that you can simulate re-running your analysis by drawing repeated samples from the data that you have. 

Below is code that will conduct a boostrapping estimator of the uncertainty of the `sqrft` variable when `lotsize` and `colonial` are included in the model. 

```{r conduct a boostrap}
bootstrap_sqft <- function(d = data, number_of_bootstraps = 1000) { 
  number_of_rows <- nrow(d)

    coef_sqft <- rep(NA, number_of_bootstraps)

    for(i in 1:number_of_bootstraps) { 
      bootstrap_data <- d[sample(x=1:number_of_rows, size=number_of_rows, replace=TRUE), ]  
      estimated_model <- lm(price ~ sqrft + lotsize + colonial, data = bootstrap_data)
      coef_sqft[i]    <- coef(estimated_model)['sqrft']
    }
  return(coef_sqft)
  }
```

```{r}
bootstrap_result <- bootstrap_sqft(number_of_bootstraps = 1000)
```

With this, it is possible to plot the distribution of these regression coefficients: 

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  aes(x = bootstrap_result) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(
    x = 'Estimated Coefficient', 
    y = 'Count', 
    title = 'Bootstrap coefficients for square footage'
  )
```

Compute the standard deviation of the bootstrapped regression coefficients.  How does this compare to the robust standard errors you computed above?
